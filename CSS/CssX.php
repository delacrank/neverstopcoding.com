<h3>Static, Relative, Fixed and Absolute Positioning</h3>

    <p>Static positioning has to do with setting a the position of an element in natural flow with other elements on the page.<br /><br />

    Relative positioning will adjust the position of the element relative to other elements, so if we set left, top, right or down property equal to a 30px, then the element will move in accordance.</p>

    <em>Code:</em>
    <!-- Code -->
    <pre class="code">
    .1 {
        position: relative;
        left: 30px;
    }
    
    .2 {
        position: static;
        left: 30px;
    }
    
    &lt;p class="1">position 1&lt;/p>
    &lt;p class="2">position 2&lt;/p>
    </pre>

<em>Example:</em>
<p style="position: relative; left: 30px">position 1</p>
<p style="position: static; left: 30px">position 2</p>

<p>If I set a fixed position then that position will remain relative to the viewport.  This means if i set it to the bottom right, reguardless of the size of the width or the hieght of the page, that element will always be located at the bottom right side of the page.<br /><br />

If I use an absolute position, then that element will remain relative to its nearest ancestor instead of the viewport.  </p>
