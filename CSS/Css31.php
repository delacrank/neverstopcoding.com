        <h1>Introduction to Sass</h1>

        <h2>Sass</h2>
        
            <p>Alright, so what is Sass and what does it stand for. Sass stands for 'Syntactically awesome style sheets', and its a preprocesser for your CSS style sheets similar to the way PhP is a preprocessor for your HTML.
        
        <span class = "nl">Sass is ideal for users who have to use a lot of css files and need some way to organize this data. We will understand how this works later, but first let's start by installing Sass. Open the terminal or command line and type in 'gem install sass'. In order to this command to work on a Windows machine you will have needed to install ruby first, because sass is built on ruby.</span></p>
        
    <em>Code:</em>
    <!-- code -->
    <pre class="code">
    <span class = "comments"># May need to use sudo if not logged in as admin</span>
    gem install sass </pre>
        
    <p>Once you have installed sass you can check the version by typing 'sass -v' in the command line. A sass file ends with .scss instead of .css, and if it works correctly then it will generate the .css files based on the coding in your sass file.
        
    <span class = "nl">It's probably best to seperate your sass files from your css files into two seperate directories. The sass program can generate and move your new css files into any directory you choose, generally people use '/sass' and '/css' for their two directories.</span>
        
    <span class = "nl">To start playing around with sass create a file in that directory (sass) and name it something like 'styles.scss'. Then navigate to that directory in the command line using the 'cd' (change directory) command and type in 'sass styles.scss styles.css'. This first command will create the css file for you, based on your .scss file.
        
    <span class = "nl">In order to have that file automatically updated everytime you make a change in the .scss file, you can use the '--watch' command. You can use watch to modify changes made an an entire directory and have the css file updated in another directory, or just point to the same directory. Either way 'sass --watch (origin):(destination)'. If you want it to stop watching just type in 'ctrl + c'.</span></span></p>
        
    <em>Code:</em>
    <!-- code -->
    <pre class="code">
    <span class = "comments"># change to your sass directory</span>
    cd /Applications/XAMPP/htdocs/sass
    <span class = "comments"># create a css file based on your sass code</span>
    sass styles.scss styles.css
     <span class = "comments"># watch for changes made in the sass file</span>
     sass --watch styles.scss : styles.css
     <span class = "comments"># watch for changes made in the sass directory</span>
     sass --watch /Applications/XAMPP/xamppfiles/htdocs/sass :
                           /Applications/XAMPP/xamppfiles/htdocs/css</pre>
        
        <p>From here you can either just make changes to your sass file and see your css file automatically be updated if you used the watch command, or make changes in your sass file and then update it using the first command 'sass styles.scss styles.css'. Either way you should have one style sheet which you write to ending in .scss and another file which is created using sass .css.</p>

    <!-- Sass partials -->
    <h3>Sass Partials</h3>
        
        <p>Let's play around with multiple sass files and see how they work to create one css sheet. The first type of sass files we are going to use are called sass partials and they look like this '_filename.scss'.
        
        <span class = "nl">Alright, well if we create a partial file then we would need some way to include it into our main css file, this is done with the '@import' directive. So you would '@import _filename.scss' or you could just '@import filename'. Sass will look for the file reguardless if you put the underscore in front or end it with the .scss when you use the import directive.</span>
        
        <span class = "nl">Let's see how we would organize this files into different directories. We could create one directory store our sass help files like variables and mixins (we will talk about these more later). Then we could use the import directive to include the foldername and the filename (dir/filename).</span></p>
        
    <em>Code:</em>
    <!-- code -->
    <pre class="code">
    @import 'helpers/variables'; </pre>
    <br />
    <hr />    
        
    <!-- Sass Variables -->    
    <h3>Sass Variables</h3>
        
        <p>Let's work with some of the sass variables now. Below, I will give examples of how to create the variables and then import it into our main sass file.
        
    <span class = "nl">Using sass variables is helpful for making multiple chnages to many different files at once. If I want to change the font color for exapmle, I won't have to worry about finding and tracking down ever h1, and p tag, I can just use a variable and change the value of that variables instead. </span></p>
        
    <em>Code:</em>
    <!-- code -->
    <pre class="code">
    <span class = "comments">/* helper sass partial file  (helpers/_variables.scss)*/</span>
    $font-color: red;</pre><br />    
        
    <em>Code:</em>
    <!-- code -->
    <pre class="code">
    <span class = "comments">/* main sass file (styles.scss) */</span>
    @import 'helpers/variables';
    
    p {
        color: $font_color;
    }
    
    h1 {
        color: $font_color;
    }</pre><br />
        
    <em>Code:</em>
    <!-- code -->
    <pre class="code">
    <span class = "comments">/* css file generated styles.css */</span>
    p {
        color: red;
    }
    
    h1 {
        color: red;
    }</pre>
        
        <p>The sass variables can be used for font-family names, borders, padding etc, anything that could be used as a value for a css rule. You can also increment or decrement from the sass variables as long as you use a pixel value and not an 'em'.</p>
        
     <em>Code:</em>
    <!-- code -->
    <pre class="code">
    p {
        color: $font_color;
        font-size: $p_size - 5px;
    }</pre><br />
