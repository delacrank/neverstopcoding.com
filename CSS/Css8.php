<h2>Using Positional Layout with CSS</h2>
<p>
First, we have to understand what exactly a layout is.  Have you ever read a newpaper or a magazine and noticed how images and content are set up in nice rows and columns.

<span class = "nl"> The same goes for webpages, we need to be able to set up our images and words so that the reader will be able to follow the information as it is displayed without getting confused or disoriented.</span>
</p>

<!-- Code Section -->
<pre class = "code">
&#60;style type = "text/css">

img {
    float: left;
}

&#60;/style>

&#60;p>
&#60;img src = "Cover5.jpg"
alt = "cover" />
The image now has its float attribute set to the left which means that, the
words will wrap around it instead of hovering underneath or next to it
&#60;/p></pre>
<br />

<!-- Example -->
<em>Example:</em>
<p>
<img class = "imgleft"
     src = "../images/Cover6.jpg"
     alt = "cover"/>

</p>

<p>
Let's try it towards the 'right' instead (by changing the float style under image to right). 
</p>

<!-- Code Section -->
<pre class = "code">
img {
    float: right;
}
</pre>
<br />

<!-- Example -->
<em>Example:</em>
<p>
<img class = "imgright"
     src = "../images/Cover6.jpg"
     alt = "cover"/>

<!-- Speficying width of float -->
<h3>Speficying Width of Float elements</h3>

<p>
It's not enough to simply float elements towards the left or right.  In order to control the behavior of the elements around the floated elements, we need to be able to control the width set inbetween the two.
</p>

<!-- Code Section -->
<pre class = "code">
&#60;style type = "text/css">

p {
    border: 2px black solid;
}

.float {
    float: left;
    width: 50%;
}

&#60;/style>

&#60;p class = "float"> A paragraph with left float. A width set to 50%. &#60;/p>

&#60;p> Another regular paragraph. &#60;/p>
</pre>
<br />

<!-- Example -->
<em>Example without width:</em>
<br />

<p class = "floatleft border">
A paragraph with left foat. A paragraph with left float. A paragraph with left foat.
</p>

<p class = "border">
Another regular paragraph. Another regular paragraph.Another regular paragraph.Another regular paragraph.Another regular paragraph.Another regular paragraph.Another regular paragraph.Another regular paragraph.
</p>

<!-- Example -->
<em>Example with width:</em>
<br />

<p class = "floatleftwidth border">
A paragraph with left foat. A paragraph with left float. A width set to 50%.
</p>

<p class = "border">
Another regular paragraph. Another regular paragraph.Another regular paragraph.Another regular paragraph.Another regular paragraph.Another regular paragraph.Another regular paragraph.Another regular paragraph.

<!-- Setting the margin -->
<h3>Setting the Margin</h3>
<p>
So far, we have become familiar with the concept of float and adjusting width to create space between floated and unfloated elements.  How about adjusting the margin to make it seem as though elements have their own space and rules.
</p>

<!-- Code Section -->
<pre class = "code">
&#60;style type = "text/css"> 
p {
    border: 2px black solid;
}

.float {
    float: left;
    width: 50%;
}

.right {
    margin-left: 52%;
}

&#60;/style> 

&#60;p class = "float"> A paragraph with float. &#60;/p>

&#60;p class = "right"> A paragraph directly to the right of the one with float. &#60;/p>
</pre>
<br />

<!-- Example -->
<em>Example:</em>
<br />

<p class = "floatleftwidth border">
A paragraph with left foat. A paragraph with left foat. A paragraph with left foat. A paragraph with left foat. A paragraph with left foat. A paragraph with left foat.
</p>

<p class = "right border">
Another regular paragraph. Another regular paragraph.Another regular paragraph.Another regular paragraph.Another regular paragraph.
