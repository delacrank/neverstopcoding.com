        <h1>Selectors - CSS Web Development</h1>
        
        <h2>Selectors</h2>
        
            <p>In this section we are going to talk about using selectors or combinations of selections together in order to define which html elements are going to be modified with our css styles. One thing you should note about selectors is that there are 5 or 6 different types of selectors based the html element tree.</p>
        
        <ul id="li">
            <li><b>Ancestors:</b> An ancestor is the selector which wraps other elements.</li>
            <li><b>Descendant:</b> The descendant of an ancestor is the element inside another tag, so the &lt;body> tag is the descendant of the &lt;html> tag.  And the &lt;h1> tag is the descendant of the &lt;body> tag.</li>
            <li><b>Parent:</b> The parent is the next closest ancestor to any descandent.  So an &lt;li> tag can be the descandent of an &lt;html> tag, but only the &lt;ul> (or &lt;ol> ) tag can be it's parent.</li>
            <li><b>Child:</b> The child is just the next closest descandent of the tag, so a list item element is the child of an unordered list element.</li>
            <li><b>Sibiling:</b> A sibiling is one of many child tags inside a parent.  So if a list has multiple elements inside an order/unordered list, then all the children are called sibilings.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Psuedo Selectors</h2>

            <p>In css we learned in previous sections how to select certain phases of a 'a' tag.  Such as visited, active, hover, and link.  One of the ways we were able to accomplish this is by using a colon to access the psuedo selector, 'a:hover'.<br /><br />
        
        In this section we are going to go into other psuedo selector and psuedo class options.</p>
        
        <hr />
        
        <!-- first letter first line -->
        <h3>:first-letter, :first-line</h3>
        
            <p>The first letter or first line selector works by changing the either the first letter or first line of the element.  Let's look at an example of this.</p>
        
    <em>Code:</em>
    <!-- code -->
    <pre class="code">
    .p:first-letter {
        font-size: 60px;
    }
    
    .p:first-line {
        font-color: red;
    }
    
    &lt;p class = "p"> Hello, this is the first line and first letter of the p class.
    Now, I can add another line and see if changes are made. &lt;/p></pre>
        
    <br />
    <em>Example:</em><br />
    <!-- example -->
    <p class = "p"> Hello, this is the first line and first letter of the p class. Now, I can add another line and see if changes are made.</p>
    
        <hr />

        <!-- focus -->
        <h3>:FOCUS</h3>
        
            <p>The :focus selector allows us to modify the appearance of an html element which we focus.  Let's look at an example below.</p>
        
    <em>Code:</em>
    <!-- code -->
    <pre class="code">
    &lt;style type = "text/css">
            
    input:focus {
        color: red;
    }
    
    &lt;/style></pre>
    <br />
        
    <em>Example:</em><br />
    <!-- Example -->
    <label>If we focus on this input box it will change its color to red.</label>
    <input type = "text"><br /><br />
    <hr />
        
    <h3>:BEFORE &amp; :AFTER</h3>
        
    <p>Let's look at using the before psuedo selector. This psuedo selector makes changes to the beginning of any html elements.</p>
        
    <em>Code:</em>
    <!-- code -->
    <pre class="code">
    &lt;style type = "text/css">
            
    .b:before {
        content: "red ";
    }
    
    .b:after {
        content: " blue";
    }
    
    &lt;/style>
    
    &lt;p class="b">ok&lt;/p></pre>
    <br />
        
    <em>Example:</em><br />
    <!-- Example -->  
    <p class="b">ok</p>
        
    <hr />
        
    <h3>::SELECTION</h3>
        
        <p>The selection helps change the appearance of any element highlighted, normally the browser will change the background color of a selected element to a light blue, let's make some changes to this.</p>
        
    <em>Code:</em>
    <!-- code -->
    <pre class="code">
    &lt;style type = "text/css">
            
    .c::selection {
        background-color: lightgreen;
        color: red;
    }
    
    &lt;/style>
    
    &lt;p class="c">ok&lt;/p></pre>
    <br />
        
    <em>Example:</em><br />
    <!-- Example -->  
    <p class="c">ok</p>
        
    <p>If you highlight the above element with your cursor or by holding down the shift key, you will see the changes. For the firefox browser we need to add what is called a vendor prefix '-moz-'.</p>
        
    <em>Code:</em>
    <!-- code -->
    <pre class="code">
    .c::<span class="red">-moz-</span>selection {
        background-color: lightgreen;
        color: red;
    }</pre>
    <hr />
        
    <h3>Attribute Selectors</h3>
    
        <p>An attribute selector is a selector we can use in order to change all elements with a certain type of html attribute.  Let's like the attribute 'title' for an 'img' tag, for every html element with title attribute in their image tag, apply this style.</p>
        
        
    <em>Code:</em>
    <!-- code -->
    <pre class="code">
    img[title] {
        color: blue;
    }</pre>
        
    <p>We can go one step further and make it so that only elements with the value of 'hello' in their title attribute are selected. </p>
        
    <em>Code:</em>
    <!-- code -->
    <pre class="code">
    img[title="hello"] {
        color: blue;
    }</pre>
        
    <p>We can also modify this so that only images that end with the file extension .png are selected. This is accomplished by using the dollar sign prior to the assignment operator.</p>
        
    <em>Code:</em>
    <!-- code -->
    <pre class="code">
    img[src$=".png"] {
        color: blue;
    }</pre>
        
    <p>Or make it so that only images come from a certain folder, by adjusting the beginning of the attribute selector. This is accomplished by using the caret ( ^ ) symbol prior to the assignment operator.</p>
        
    <em>Code:</em>
    <!-- code -->
    <pre class="code">
    img[src^="../Images2/"] {
        color: blue;
    }</pre>
        
        <p>Selectors which use the caret ^ symbol will only modify elements who have the attribute value which begins with the quoted words. While those selectors which use the dollar symbol only refer to attribute values whose quoted values are in the end of the attribute.
        
    <span class = "nl">There is also a way to use a universal attribute selector which adds this style to any attribute which contains the value reguardless of it's location. That selector is the asterisk star *. Let's look at an example.</span></p>
        
    <em>Code:</em>
    <!-- code -->
    <pre class="code">
    &lt;style type = "text/css">
    
    p[title^="goodnight"] {
        color: red;
    }
    
    p[title$="goodnight"] {
        color: blue;
    }
    
    p[title*="moon"] {
        background-color: yellow;
    }   
    &lt;/style>
    
    &lt;p title = "goodnight moon"> hello &lt;/p>
    
    &lt;p title = "moon goodnight"> hello &lt;/p>
    
    &lt;p title = " goodnight "> hello &lt;/p></pre>
        
    <br />    
        
    <em>Example:</em>
    <!-- example --><br />
    
    <p title = "goodnight moon"> hello </p>
    
    <p title = "moon goodnight"> hello </p>
    
    <p title = " goodnight "> hello </p>
        
    <p>Notice how the last element wasn't changed in color, this is because it is neither in front or towards the back of the attribute value's quotes. The rule is that the style has to be touching either the front quote to use the ^, or the back quote to use the $, selector.</p> <hr />
