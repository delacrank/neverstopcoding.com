      <h1>Remote, Branching and Merging</h1>

      <p>In this section we are going to go into understand how to create a branch how to add a remote repository and how to merge two branches together.</p>

      <h2>Adding remote</h2>

      <p>After you create your initial git profile and added a remote repository the next step is to connect that repository to your local harddisk. In the first section we saw how we can add a remote repo to our local drive by simply using the 'git remote add origin2 https://github/username/reponame.git'.

	<span class = "nl">Great, we just added a new repository but we still need the files on it. So let's run the fetch command now 'git fetch origin2'. Since the files are now located in our directory they are going to be on a different branch. To view the number of remotes that we have use the 'git remote'.</span></p>

    <em>Code:</em>
    <pre class = "code">
    <span class = "comments"># add a remote</span>
    git remote add origin2 https://github.com/username/reponame.git
    <span class ="comments"># get content</span>
    git fetch origin2
    <span class = "comments"># show remotes</span>
    git remote</pre>

    <p>Now we have two remote repositories to choose from and since we used the fetch command we can actually checkout the new repository which was created once we fetched the content. We can also remove a remote by using the 'git remote rm &lt;remotename>'.</p>

  <h2>Git Branching</h2>

  <p>In order to understand a branch in git first we need to understand how commits are stored and how we move back forth each commit. In short each commit is a pointer to our localdisk, and everytime we create a new commit that adds another pointer to our disk, so if I have 3 commits then the HEAD is stored at the 3rd commit and reverting to prior versions is as simple as pointer the HEAD to a previous commit (thus reset HEAD command).

    <span class = "nl">Now, let's understand how branches work. Imagine that a branch is just a mirror version of a commit, and the HEAD pointer is located on the current branch then switching branches is a matter of pointing the HEAD to another branch. In order to create a branch you need to use the 'git branch &lt;branchname>' command. And if we want to switch to that branch then 'git checkout &lt;branchname>'.</span>

    <span class = "nl">Let's see if we can switch to the remote repository we connected to earlier. This can be done by switching the branch so let's checkout the origin2/master branch 'git checkout origin2/master'. You will notice your local working directory has been replaced with this remote repository. However, your work is not lost, you can always switch back to your origin branch 'git checkout origin/master'.</span></p>

  <em>Code:</em>
  <pre class = "code">
  <span class = "comments"># switch to remote branch</span>
  git checkout origin2/master
  <span class = "comments"># switch back</span>
  git checkout origin/master</pre>    

      <p>If we switched back to our master, we can also create a new branch out of our existing code base 'git branch test'. We can use the 'git show-branch' command to observe all the branches for the current repo. If we make changes to this new branch and then decide to combine this new branch with our master we can use the merge command 'git merge test'.</p>

  <em>Code:</em>
  <pre class = "code">
  <span class = "comments"># create a new branch</span>
  git branch test
  <span class = "comments"># switch to that branch</span>
  git checkout test
  <span class = "comments"># create a new file</span>
  echo "test" > new.txt
  git commit -a -m "new file"
  git checkout master
  <span class = "comments"># merge the two branches</span>
  git merge test</pre>
