    <h2>About the Author</h2>
    
        <p> My name is Juan Carlos, in 2014 I graduated with BA in Computer Information Systems. Currently I reside in Brooklyn and enjoy programming on my offtime.  My goal is to obtain an entry level position as a developer.  This website is a sample of some of the things I have learned through books and other sources online.
        
        <span class = "nl">I created this website on weekends as a learning guide for myself and others.  This site has many references from books I have read and below, I will cite many of the books and examples of code used from them.  I hope you can enjoy reading and learning from this site as much as I enjoyed writing it.</span>
        
        <span class = "nl">Hopefully if you are just starting out or if you are continuing your education, this will serve as motivation to move forward with your goals, reguardless of how daunting or time consuming they may be : )</span></p>

    <h2>How to navigate the site</h2>
    
        <p>If you haven't noticed, this is a pretty large website containing over 400 pages.  There is a menu bar on the left column which contains links to the various sections, for those who are more experienced or need a quick reference point skip ahead to the section you need.  Alternatively, you can simply go through each section clicking next on the bottom of the page.</p>

   <h2>2024-12-24 16:44 Update:</h2>
   
    <p>It's been 3 years and 3 months since I last updated this website. Since then, I finally aquired a position at one of the big banks jpmc or Chase bank. Unfortunately I wasn't able to secure the position for more than a month. There was this one obnoxious female co worker that gave me a really hard time, and basically this led to her complaining to management and me getting fired.

    <span class="nl">For the most part I don't really care, the experience allowed me to move down to Florida and get a raise and I even met someone and dated for about 7 months before breaking it off. But recently, we are trying to work it out. This was in part due to be asking the initial company to take me back and they even gave me a raise.</span>
   
    <span class = "nl">During these last three years, I have grown so much as a developer and have learned so much about human connection and learning soft skills. My developer skills also improved a lot, and I have learned how to be a better developer and handle more responsibilities.  Being a professional developer is extremely challenging and companies seem to have a way to always ask you to take on more tasks the more you perform.</span>
   
    <span class = "nl">One thing that I am working on is learning networking skills. I recently bought a router, a switch and a a few rasberry pi's in order to set up a home lap. I am also going to go back into focusing on doing some game development as well.</span></p>

   <h2>2021-09-02 01:20 Update:</h2>

    <p>Wow, I can't believe how long its been since I've bothered to update this website. I guess over a year has passed. A lot of things have changed and a lot of things have actually remained the same. I am not sure if I have become a better programmer since then, its certainly a possibility.

    <span class = "nl">It feels weird to use emacs again since I've last touched it. Recently, I acquired a new job. In this position I am working as a full stack java angular developer. In many ways this is what I've been aiming for all along. In essence phase one of my journey is complete, now I just need to focus on phase 2 which is actually building games. </span>

    <span class = "nl">I think I will focus on finishing up my java swing/desktop learning and maybe some tutorial programming as well. Build some games in java and then eventually move on to c++ and c. I am wondering now if I will ever get around to doing the whole leet code data structures and algorithms route, but at this time it really feels moot to me.</span></p>

    <h2>2020-08-09 21:00 Update</h2>

    <p>Quite some time has passed since I wrote on this site. I am really happy with the progressing I have been making in reference to learning about spring and angular. Although, I haven't been programming as much in the past 2 months, I have been making up for that in reading and studying.

<span class = "nl">Recently, I decided to go back and read the majority of the Spring in Action 4th edition book. This has filled in a lot of the gaps of my knowledge and made it signficantly easier for me to read and understand much of the documentation pertaining not only to the framework but also to developing a SOA (service oriented architecture).  One of the biggest struggles that I have had with spring with mastering some of the components, this in turn made it extremely difficult for me to understand how to go about building my application.</span>

<span class = "nl">I started to realize that in order for me to start to feel comfortable with using this framework I would have to invest more time in studying and less in developing. Hibernate was a big struggle for me, similarly trying to use some of the tools like lombok for making beans less verbose only made it more confusing and created an additional layer of complexity. If I had approached this project more cautiously and learning the fundamentals of spring without jumping into spring boot then this project would have probably been more successful.</span>

<span class = "nl">Lastly, understanding some of the design patterns like the singleton, factory or builder pattern helped me to really understand why some of the classes were being designed and the purpose for designing them as such. At this point I am uncertain if I should keep applying or if I should focus more of my time in programming. I really want to start the cracking the coding interview book, but I am uncertain of what to do next.</span>

    <hr />
	
    <h2>2020-06-15 21:00 Update</h2>

    <p>Wow, the last 3 weeks have been really painful. I wasn't able to complete any work on my game forum application since I really injured my neck. Recently, I sort of solved this problem by bringing my monitor closer and taking a break from using the computer. In many ways this was a really good thing, I spent more time out doors and got in better shape.

      <span class = "nl">One thing that I have been really lagging behind in is building the mockup for the application. I am not sure why I always dread doing any type of frontend or design things. I think, as I spend more time doing these sorts of things they will eventually become easier. One thing that I have mad progress on was deploying my application to AWS (amazon web services). I thought this was going to be extremely complicated and difficult because I wanted to use the EC2 instances and was worried about costs and configuration. It turned out to be much simpler than I thought.

      <span class = "nl">There's a part of me that wants to keep developing and deploying more spring applications, however I also feel strongly motivated towards keeping up with my game development skills and start to work on doing some pixel art as well. I might just start working fulltime as a courier and only work on programming when I get out of work.</span></p>

    <hr />

    <h2>2020-04-04 12:00 Update</h2>

    <p>Still going relatively hard in learning this java spring now coupled with adding angular to it. My command line skills have been improving a lot. Additionally, I have been learning a lot about micro services, apis, different types of rest requests and so on. I am currently integrating another book into my learning 'Pro Spring Boot 2'.

      <span class = "nl">It's hard to be objective and tell whether I am learning a lot or not. I feel strongly that if I can overcome the bad days then I can make more progress in a shorter period of time. Just overcoming the feeling of burnout without putting my health at risk is something that terrifies me.</span></p>

    <hr />
	
    <h2>2019-12-21 16:00 Update</h2>

    <p>Geez, I am feeling really burned out. I have been going at a tremendous pace learning java jsp's and trying to get up to speed on learning the spring framework. Even thou the progress I have made learning java is incredible, I am still not near my goals. Recently, I attended an interview which I am not sure went well or not, however it inspired me to start learning the Angular Framework which I have been putting off for quite a while now.

    <span class = "nl">I am noticing that my control over the emacs is becoming stronger and stronger as I keep using it more and more. Especially when I am working in dired mode, renaming, moving, adding new files or directories is becoming much easier. Searching for text replacing characters all of this has become much, much faster.</span>

    <span class = "nl">Also, I have been more or less pretty consistent about applying to different jobs. I realize now, that one of my faults is that I haven't been as consistent as I need to be about putting myself out there. Lately, I just feel really stressed about pushing myself so much, however this cannot be avoided if I really want to learn these technologies. I am not sure how it is for other programmers, I just know that even thou I have been programming for all these years it still feels difficult. A lot of the information that I have previously learned does help to make learning this technology easier but it still feels like a beast of a stack to learn.</span></p>

    <hr />

    <h2>2019-09-18 23:17 Update</h2>

    <p>It's actually been close to almost a year since I contributed to this site. Amazingly, I have grown so much as a programmer since then. The beauty of programming is that you can only get better as you continue to grow and learn.

      <span class = "nl">Guess what finally happened. I finally got my first job as a full stack web developer at this company starting at 52k. To be honest I was expecting more but I guess I didn't really negotiate, it was my first job and to be honest I really walked away better for the experience.</span>

      <span class = "nl">Two of the major tools I learned was github, and Ajax. I also learned a php framework called CodeIgniter but I didn't feel that would be very relevant to my future. Although, I did learn the value of using a framework and the speed achieved through using tools like that. I also learned a lot about the enviroment and the expectations of a programmer.</span>

      <span class = "nl">All of this happened after I finally taught myself C, and this time I learned it really well (what a relief). I had tried to learn C before but I found it was really difficult and I struggled with a lot of the Game Programming books because I wasn't very knowledgable at the low level languages. Additionally, learning C really improved my C++ and I was finally able to get through this book called Aceelerated C++ (which I really struggled with before).</span>

      <span class = "nl">I stayed at the job for only 3 months, which is where I felt like I couldn't learn anymore. I probably could but the pace of my learning was really stunted once I got familiar with the tools, then it was more work and less challenging. When I got home I dove back into learning game programming and actually made it halfway through this DirectX programming book. Furthermore I learned Emacs and some of the Win32 API.</span>

      <span class = "nl">Thats all for now, I am currently learning Java for Web development and will eventually learn Angular JS. Check under the Web section to see updates.</span></p>

    <hr />
    
    <h2>2018-11-23 02:05 Update</h2>
    
        <p>Oh man this is so crazy. I haven't really contributed to this site that much since I started writing articles for gamedevforums.net. 
        
        <span class = "nl">Going over C again, this time going more indept into every aspect of programming, doing all the exercises and really understanding const pointers and pointers to const has been so therapeutic. I told myself, I am going to take a break from web programming since I got really burned out after building that forum.</span>
        
        <span class = "nl">Funny how I surprised myself by deciding to finally learn data structures and algorithms. I told myself I wasn't going to bother learning them in a language like javascript or python, whats the point of that.</span>
        
        <span class = "nl">I struggled for a long time to understand why structs or classes weren't passed by value and instead had instances which were dynamically allocated on the heap. It's strange to because you would think after spending so much time reading all these books on C++ programming that the authors would explain these things.</span>
        
        <span class = "nl">Maybe I wasn't paying attention or maybe the books didn't bother explaining them. Yet, this book, 'C Programming: A Modern Approach' covers these topics and more in detail.</span>
        
        <span class = "nl">After I learn these data structures and algorithms, I am going to improve my front end development skills even more. I really purchased CSS Definitive Guide and the Javascript Definitive Guide. I really wanted to dive into UNIX and VIM, but it seems like aquiring a job is just more important to me in the moment.</span></p>

    <h2>2018-10-04 15:46 Update</h2>
    
        <p>Just finished writing all the code for the frontend which includes a popup modal for the sign-in, registration and forgot password forms.
        
        <span class = "nl">I also included a really nice hamburger style menu navigation for the mobile version of the site and wrote a lot of the media queries for smaller resolutions (down to 320px).</span>
        
        <span class = 'nl'>For now this concludes my work on the forum, I will now start to focus on more mathetical aspects of programming in c and understanding data structures/algorithms.</span>
        
        <span class = 'nl'>Honestly, I anticipate this will take me close to 8 months. Not because the material will require 8 months, but my approach in learning these topics is usually very extensive. This time is sufficient in order for me to have an extremely thorough understanding on these topics.</span>
        
        <span class = 'nl'>As for the forum I will deploy it by next week and will only do minor maintence on it.  This will include adding articles here and there (on game development) as well as art and creating better layouts.</span>
        
        <span class = 'nl'>Currently, I will finally update my section on C programming on this website and will eventually go into more Unix development (bash scripting) with details for working with advanced text editors like VIM.</span></p>

    <h2>2018-09-21 15:46 Update</h2>
    
        <p>Jesus, I am freaking exhausted. Would you guys believe that I just built a forum in practically 2 months. 
    
        <span class ='nl'>I never imagined it would have been so much work, I really out did myself this time. I added a lot more features to this forum then last time. These new systems include an imagine handling script, private messaging system, better overall security (password hashing/salting over encryption). </span>
    
        <span class = "nl">It's a good thing I go to meetups now, because my growth has expanded exponentially with the new input I get from talking to other programmers.  Today, I learned what a rainbow table is, lol. Its a database which contains every encrypted possibily for words and then just checks those against encrpytions stored in your database.</span>
    
        <span class = "nl">I'm in the process of writing a lot of the frontend code, the php and html alone is around 2400 lines not including the captcha system. So far its around 500 lines of css and 200 lines of javascript.</span>
    
        <span class = "nl">Also, my javascript probably sucks so I'm probably going to spend some time on free code camp maybe just for fun.</span></p>
    
        <hr />
    
    <h2>2018-07-28 01:54 Update:</h2>
    
        <p>I decided to go with getting more advanced with php and I am already scripts into building this forum. I have already draw some graphics and colored them in using photoshop.
    
        <span class = "nl">Going to all these meetups and even a job workshop really expanded my views on some the programmers out there. This has given me perspective on my own ablities (I am probably way more experienced then I initially imagined).</span>
    
        <span class = "nl">Yet, in some areas I am still really behind, in terms of reaching out and dealing with people. This probably comes down a lot to personality, interests and goals.</span>
    
        <span class = "nl">In the past few days, I learned a lot about php. I went back and watched all of derek banas videos, on php and security. Some of the videos which seemed overwhelming at first, didn't bother me this time around.</span>
    
        <span class = "nl">It's interesting in the beginning you feel like everytime you fail or take a long time to learn something, that those experiences are bad. When in reality, they show that we are making the most growth. I am going to strive to keep pushing my limits and growing, not only as a programmer but also as a person.</span></p>

    <h2>2018-06-30 00:44 Update:</h2>
    
        <p>Adding an SEO section to the site, fixed some issues with broken links or incomplete side bars for some of the sections. Right now I'm currently about 2/5 (page 358, of 1000) through reading this book called the Art of SEO, its a pretty good book although repetitive in some sections.
    
        <span class = "nl">I've been debating what to focus on for my next topic of study. The decision is between between learning: full stack javascript w/ React (MERN stack), getting advanced with PhP, learning math/algorithms or going into more depth with .NET.</span>
            
        <span class ='nl'>Something tells me that I will likely dive back into more PHP, and focus on building applications before moving into math. I feel like this is best decision because it is the one area that I feel the most comfortable with and have the most knowledge in currently.</span>
    
        <span class = 'nl'>I'm going to add analytics to this site and I recently updated my sitemap.xml file. I really enjoyed making and maintaining this site, I look forward to making a better forum focusing on game development for my next project.</span></p>
    
    <hr />
    
    <h2>2018-06-15 14:44 Update:</h2>
    
        <p>A few changes have happened recently, I pretty much covered reading the majority of 'Professional Javascript for Web Developers'. Frankly, it puts most of the javascript books out there to shame. I'm going to finish updating the jQuery section of my website and then look to build another forum.
    
        <span class = "nl">I am also in the process of learning search engine optimization. One set back was a change which my shared hosting provider made to their website broke all of my code for parsing php scripts in my html files.</span>
    
        <span class ="nl">You could say, why not just rename your html files to php and that should solve the problem. However even if I wrote a bash script which could do that, I would still have to go in and change every single link on my website and with over 300 something pages of html and several php files, that would be extremely tedious.</span>
    
        <span class = "nl">Not to mention some of the php errors which could be generated in the process of me doing this. I pretty much had to change the configuration of my '.htacess' file (adds commands to apache server config file). Here's the line of code that I added.</span></p>
    
        <em>Code:</em>
        <!-- code -->
        <pre class="code">
        Options +ExecCGI
        AddHandler application/x-httpd-lsphp .html</pre>
    
        <p>Well, thats all for now. Hopefully, after I get more comfortable with jQuery and SEO I will start building my new website.

        <span class = "nl">Learning math is something that I have put off for a really long time, but now more then ever I realize how necessary it is for learning problem solving skills.

        <p>Going to revisit Javascript, I am already halfway through the .NET book, and then I realized that web forms is probably a really old technology. Now, there is this thing called .NET Core which is the lastest and greatest implementation of the framework.
    
        <span class = "nl">Either way, I am going to focus on adding more to my javascript section. Recently, I fixed a bug with a lot of the jQuery not working simply because I forgot to include the file when I moved to the godaddy servers (lol).</span>

    <h2>2017-12-28 2:29 Update:</h2>
    
        <p>I've been to about three interviews in the last month. It turns out my new website portfolio has really been giving me an advantage in getting more call backs. I did really terribly in one of the interviews where the interviewer basically email the same day and told me I would not get the position. 
    
        <span class = "nl">I felt maybe they were looking for someone more advanced because I fell short when they were asking me questions about using multiple databases like using NoSQL databases and questions about using Ms SQL. It turns out a lot of companies are actually looking for people who know .NET in addition to just PhP.</span>
    
        <span class = "nl">I think I did better in the other interviews because they were looking for more of a junior developer, although one was in long island. I've been spending a lot more time learning Ms SQL and the .NET framework. I've also added a section on algorithms.</span>
    
        <span class = "nl">One of the things I am looking forward to is expanding my knowledge of algorthims and being more flexiable with the information I am learning. I really started to get burned out on learning so much PhP. After I finish this book on .NET Programming, I want to learn WordPress and Laravel although I am not sure what order that will be in.</span>
    
        <span class = "nl">I feel like in the two years since I really started taking programming more seriously, I am going through these books a lot faster. In my ASP.Net Book, I only started reading it like 2 weeks ago and I am already on page 230 (its a 800 page book). Well, thats all for now, check out my new sections under .NET web applications, and programming algorithms.</span>
