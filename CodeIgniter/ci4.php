        <h1>Views</h1>

        <p>In this section we are going to be talking about views and how to create them. One of the most interesting features of views is how controllers pass data to our views.  If for example we store data in an array called '$data' and then initialize the fields of that array, we should be able to access those elements in our view.

        <span class = "nl">Later on we will see how important this is for when we are using our models. The views are also important for being able to store data and pass it back to a controller. So a view and a controller have a reciprocal relationship.</span>
        </p>

        <hr />

        <h2>View Controller ex.</h2>

            <p>Let's see an example where we pass data into a controller and then display this in a view.</p>

    <em>Code:</em>
    <!-- code -->
    <pre class="code">
    &lt;?php
    class Boo extends CI Controller {
        public function ok() {
            $data['name'] = "Carlos";
            $data['phone'] = "123456789";
            $data['address'] = "244 munster street";
            $data['jobs'] = array(
                'carpenter',
                'electrician',
                'plumber'
            );   
            <span class = "comments">// loading the view here</span>
            $this->load->view('profile', $data);
        }
    }
    ?></pre>    

    <p>In the example above I initialized several fields in my array to strings, and then I created an array within my data array and initialized those fields to different jobs.

    <span class = "nl">Let's look at a view and see how we can render some of this information.</span>
    </p>

    <em>Code:</em>
    <!-- code -->
    <pre class = "code">
    <span class = "comments">// views/profile.php</span>
    &lt;html>
        &lt;head>
            &lt;title>Profile&lt;/title>
        &lt;/head>
        &lt;body>
            &lt;h1>Profile info&lt;/h1>
    
            &lt;?php
            echo '&lt;p>My name is ' . $name . ' &lt;/p>';
            echo '&lt;p>My phone number is is ' . $phone . ' &lt;/p>';
            echo '&lt;p>My address is ' . $address . ' &lt;/p>';
            ?>

            &lt;h3>My Jobs&lt;/h3>
    
            &lt;ul>
            &lt;?php foreach ($jobs as $job):?>
    
                    &lt;li>&lt;?= $job;?>&lt;/li>
    
            &lt;?php endforeach;?>
            &lt;/ul>
        &lt;/body>
        &lt;/html>
    </pre>

    <p>Thats going to be all for now on views, in our next section we are going to talk about models and this is where things are going to start to get interesting.</p>
