        <h1>Intro to Code Igniter</h1>
            <p>This is a going to be a short into to using a complicated framework. Code Igniter is a php framework which uses OOP. If you don't know PhP or Object Oriented Programming then you probably won't be able to follow along with the material well.</p>

        <h2>Resources</h2>

            <p>First let's talk about where to go to download Code Igniter and what you will need to get up and started. I recently started using this editor called vscode, I am finding that it is a more capable then brackets with less bugs and not as bloated as eclispe so I suggest you try it out.

            <span class ="nl">Downloading and installing Code Igniter is pretty simple, just go to their <a target="_blank" href="https://www.codeigniter.com">wesbite</a> and download the lastest version. From here you basically drop that folder and its contents into the directory you will be using for your website.</span>

            <span class = "nl">Another suggestion I would make is setting up xdebug for debugging your application. Well xdebug and xampp, however these are some tools that I have mentioned in previous tutorials doing a simply query on any web browser should show you where to go to download and install these.</span>

        <h2>First App</h2>

            <p>In the next section we will start by building our first web application. However you should know that code igniter has its own documentation which I think might be more useful then what I will be providing.</p>
