        <h1>Setting Up - Assembly Development</h1>
        
        <h2>Setting Up</h2>
        
            <p>Hello, welcome to my tutorial on assembly level programming.  In order to follow along with this tutorial you will need a 32 bit version of a linux distrubtion.
        
    <span class = "nl">If you aren't currently using a Linux OS, then I suggest either downloading a Linux OS and booting your computer from a USB drive.  You can use this <a href = "https://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/create-a-usb-stick-on-windows" target = "_blank">tutorial</a> for that option.</span>
        
    <span class ="nl">However, another option is using virtualization. If you want to boot up a Linux OS from within the same machine, then you can download a free version of <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads" target="_blank">Virtual Box</a>. I suggest using a light weight 32 bit version of the Linux Distro, there is assembly in 64 bit OS's yet this tutorial will not be covering that.</span>
        
    <span class="nl">There are some things to note when trying to 'assemble' assembly. First, different CPU's require different syntaxes or opcodes. Secondly, there are different 'Assemblers' required to build assembly. Third, different OS's require different syntaxes in order to assemble, assembly programs.</span>
        
     <span class = "nl">Let's look at the different types of 'Assemblers' and their respective websites.  This tutorial will be using <a href="https://sourceware.org/binutils/docs/as/" target="_blank">GAS</a> or the GNU assembler. There is also <a href="http://www.nasm.us/index.php" target="_blank">NASM</a> assembler and a <a href="http://www.masm32.com/" target="_blank">MASM</a> which is made for Microsoft OS's.</span>
        
    <span class="nl">Most MASM and NASM assemblers require the '.asm' file extension.  However, GNU's assembler only requires the '.s' file extention. All assembly programs create something called 'object code'.  Once these object code files are created, we require a linker in order to create our executable file, or machine code. The object code files end with the '.o' file extention. Once the linker has successfully combined our object code files together the file extention will either be '.exe' for a Microsoft OS's, or a '.dmg' file for a Mac machine.</span></p>

    <h2>Why Assembly</h2>
        
        <p>In order to understand why we need to learn assembly language, we must first understand what happens to our HLL (Higher Level Language) programs when we compile them. All of our HLL's such as C, C++, Java, etc. will get compiled into assembly and then assembled into machine code using a linker. An assembler takes the assembly code and assembles it into into bit patterns (machine code or binary, i.e. 0100 1100). These bit patterns are usually encoded as hexidecimal (1 - 16), where the numbers 10 - 16 are made up of characters A through F.
        
    <span class = "nl">So, the question is how good are our compilers?  When we write a program using a HLL, we are completely dependent on that compiler to produce our machine code.  However, compilers are built to be able to accomodate many different CPU's and OS's. This means the code that it generates might not always as efficient as the developer would like it to be.</span>
        
    <span class = "nl">Knowing Assembly gives the developer the ability to take apart a program and optimize it.</span></p>
