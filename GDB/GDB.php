        <h1>Setting up - Gnu Debugger</h1>
        
        <h2>What is GDB</h2>
        
            <p>GDB stands for the Gnu Debugger. If you didn't already know what Gnu stands for it means Gnu Not Unix, and they were a series of software tools built for people to use freely. In order to understand how to use 'GDB' we must first install it.

        <h3>Installing GDB</h3>
        
        <p><span class = "nl">If you have homebrew installed on your computer then you can type in terminal: 'brew install gdb'. If you don't already have homebrew, you can download from <a target="_blank" href="http://brew.sh/">here</a>.</span></p>
        
    <em>Code:</em>
    <!-- code -->
    <pre class="code">
    brew install gdb</pre>
        
        <p>Once you have properly installed gdb you can check the version on it by typing in gdb -version. Or for commands gdb -help. To get started let's start by opening a source file maybe something simple at first.
        
        <span class = "nl">Imagine for example that you wanted to debug a program, you would need to compile it using the '-g' argument. Below is a 'hello world' program in c plus plus.</span></p>
        
    <em>Code:</em>
    <!-- code -->
    <pre class="code">
    #include &lt;iostream>
    
    int main()
    {
        std::cout &lt;&lt; "Hello, World." &lt;&lt; std::endl;
        
        return 0;
    }</pre>
        
        <p>Normally, to compile this program, we would type in 'g++ hello.cpp -o hello'. where hello.cpp is the source file and -o hello would be the name of the executable file. 
            
        <span class="nl">Since I am working on a Mac, I will be typing in 'clang++' because this will not cause any errors with my gdb build. 'clang' is just another c compiler, 'clang++' stands for c plus plus.</span>    
            
        <span class = "nl">Using GDB, we need to add this extra argument '-g', so our command would look somehting like this.</span></p>
        
    <em>Code:</em>
    <!-- code -->
    <pre class="code">
    clang++ <span class = "red">-g</span> hello.cpp -o hello</pre>
        
        <p>Now, if you want to start debugging this program we need to first start 'gdb', so type in gdb and the name of the executable file 'gdb hello'.</p>
        
    <em>Code:</em>
    <!-- code -->
    <pre class="code">
    gdb hello</pre>
        
        <p>Now we have opened our executable file under our debugger.  Of course if you didn't name it then you would need to type in 'gdb a.out' in order to for it to run.
    
    <span class = "nl">In the next section we will see how to run some commands in order to retrieve the values of our variables or functions.</span></p>
