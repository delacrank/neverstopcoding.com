    <h1>HashCodes &amp; toString - Java Programming</h1>
    
    <h2>hashCodes &amp; toString</h2>
    
        <p>First, let's understand what a hashCode is, a hashCode is an integer derived from an object.  The purpose of using a hashCode is to determine when two variables are equal or different from one another.  To see a variables hashCode, just call the method.</p>
    
    <em>Code:</em>
    <!-- code -->
    <pre class="code">
    String S = "w";
    
    System.out.println(w.hashCode());</pre>
    
        <p>In order to determine the 'hashCodes' from a certain class, they are passed through an algorithm. Below, is the algorithm used to determine all the hash codes from the string class.</p>
    
    <em>Code:</em>
    <!-- code -->
    <pre class="code">
    int hash = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; length(); i++)
        hash = 31 * hash + charAt(i);</pre>
    
        <p>Let's say we want to implement a hashCode method for our employee class.  Then we could determine the hashCodes for every object in our class.  We could do somethign similar to this.</p>
    
    <em>Code:</em>
    <!-- code -->
    <pre class="code">
    <span class = "comments">// Scrammble the values</span>
    public int hashCode() {
        return 7 * Objects.hashCode(name)
        + 11 * Double.hashCode(Salary);
    }</pre>
    
        <p>Or, we could just call the 'hash' method via the 'Object' class, like so.</p>
    
    <em>Code:</em>
    <!-- code -->
    <pre class="code">
    <span class = "comments">// Let's use the 'hash' method instead</span>
    public int hashCode() {
        return Objects.hash(name, Salary); 
    }</pre>
    
    <p>Hash Codes serve as a unique identifer for comparing variables.  It is import to distinguish the difference between equality in value and equality in address.  If you create a new instance of an object, then this new object is going to have a different address reguardless if the value of that object is actually equal to another.
    
    <span class = "nl">If we add this 'hashCode()' method to our employee class, we can determine whether two objects are equal to each other, by returning the hashCodes from those objects.</span></p>
    
    <em>Code:</em>
    <!-- code -->
    <pre class="code">
    Employee emp = new Employee("John", 30000);
    Employee emp2 = new Employee("John", 30000);
    Employee emp3 = new Employee("Susan", 60000);
    
    <span class = "comments">// Display the hash values for our 3 objects</span>
    System.out.println("emp hashCode(): " + emp.hashCode());
    System.out.println("emp2 hashCode(): " + emp2.hashCode());
    System.out.println("emp3 hashCode(): " + emp3.hashCode());</pre>
    
    
    <hr />
    
    <!-- toString -->
    <h3>toString() Method</h3>
    
        <p>Another important method for constructing classes is being able to see the value of an object displayed in characters or as a string.  One of the ways we do this is by printing out the value of are fields within a string.
    
    <span class = "nl">Let's look at an example of this by creating a 'toString()' method for our employee class, maybe we want to display the values of our fields 'name' and 'Salary' as strings.</span></p>
    
    <em>Code:</em>
    <!-- code -->
    <pre class = "code">
    public String toString() {
        return getClass().getName()
        + "[name=" + name
        + ", salary=" + Salary
        + "]";
    }</pre>
    
        <p>The same thing can be done for our subclass as well, as long as we use just the 'super' accessor to call the 'toString()' method from our superclass.
    
    <span class = "nl">We should be able to easily call this method, let's look at an example before we move on.</span></p>
    
    <em>Code:</em>
    <!-- code -->
    <pre class = "code">
    Employee emp = new Employee("John", 30000);
    
    System.out.println(emp.toString());</pre>
