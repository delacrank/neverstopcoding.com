    <h1>Classes - Java Programming</h1>
    
    <h2>Classes</h2>
    
        <p>Programming languages come in different forms, they are centered around data and manipulating that data via algorithms. An algorithm is a set of instructions, so to open a door you need to use an algorithm: unlock, turn knob, pull.
    
    <span class = "nl">The way most languages work is by seperating these algorithms into something called a function. The idea is that we can process the data using an algorithm stored in a function and return the desired result.</span>
    
    <span class = "nl">Programming that is based on seperating data and functions is called 'Procedural Programming'. This is because the functions can be also known as procedures, subroutines, etc. etc.</span>
    
    <span class = "nl">Java is not a procedural programming language, it is an object based language, I will get into what that means in a moment. An object is an abstract way of solving a problem, rather than seperating our code into data and functions, an object will combine them.</span>
    
    <span class = "nl">When you start orienting your programs around using objects to solve problems rather than calling functions, you can isolate problems that occur later on in the code.</span>
    
    <span class = "nl">The idea is that you can use a certain object to solve a particular problem, and then if there was a bug, know where to look (the object) to fix the bug. This is because objects support 'encapsulation', this basically means that you can declare certain variables 'private' or 'protected' meaning that other data or functions cannot change them.</span>
    
    <span class = "nl">Let's look at an example of a class.</span></p>
    
    <em>Code:</em>
    <!-- code -->
    <pre class = "code">
    <span class = "comments">// Class name</span>
    class Employee {
        
        <span class = "comments">// private fields</span>
        private String name;
        private int badges;
        
        <span class = "comments">// Constructor</span>
        public Employee(String n, int b)
        {
            name = n;
            badges = b;
        }
        
        <span class = "comments">// Accessor method</span>
        public String getName()
        {
            return name;
        }
        
        <span class = "comments">// Accessor method</span>
        public int getBadges()
        {
            return badges;
        }
        
        <span class = "comments">// Mutator method</span>
        public void changeBadges(int cb)
        {
            badges = cb;
        }
        
    }</pre>
    
        <p>Let's understand what all of this means, let's start with our 'Employee' class.  The first thing you will notice are the private fields 'name' and 'badges'.  These are just variables which only the methods within the class can access.
    
    <span class = "nl">Next let's take a look at the first function or method, it's actually a constructor.  Using the constructor not only initializes the class object but, it can also set the values to our private variables. It is called a constructor because it is the method used to construct the object.</span>
    
    <span class = "nl">Next we have two accessor methods, these will return the values to our private variables.  Since these variables are private we can only see their values by using a method, rather than calling them using the '.' dot operator.</span>
    
    <span class = "nl">Then we have a 'mutator' method, a mutator method is a method which can change the value of one of our private variables. Using the mutator method we can change the value to the amount of badges an employee has.</span></p>
    
    <em>Code:</em>
    <!-- code -->
    <pre class="code">
    <span class = "comments">// Create a file for our main method</span>
    class TestEmployee {
        
        public static void main(String[] args)
        {
            <span class = "comments">// Initialize our Employee object with these values</span>
            Employee E = new Employee("June", 30);
            
            <span class = "comments">// Return the name</span>
            System.out.printf("Name: %s\n", E.getName());
            
            <span class = "comments">// Return badge amount</span>
            System.out.printf("Badges: %d\n", E.getBadges());
            
            <span class = "comments">// Change the phone number</span>
            E.changeBadges(40);
            
            <span class = "comments">// Print new amount of badges</span>
            System.out.printf("New Badge Amount: %d\n", E.getBadges());
        }
    
    }</pre>
    
    <p>Now, let's look at our main method, it will be the method we can use to call all of these methods from our class. However, in order to call any methods we must first instantiate our 'Employee' object.
    
    <span class = "nl">To do this we will have to use the 'new' variable.  That just places the memory for that object on the heap so that it won't go out of scope once the 'main' method ends.</span>
    
    <span class = "nl">So we initialized our 'E' object with the 'Employee' constructor, now we can call methods from this class using this 'E' object. However, we can create multiple objects of the 'Employee' class each with their own set of values for the string and badge variables.</span>
    
    <span class = "nl">Next we just called the 'getName()' and 'getBadge()' accessor methods to return the values stored in these private variables.  Following this, we call our mutator method 'changeBadges()' to see if it affects the private variable. We can call our accessor method again to check to see if the value has changed.</span>
    
    <span class = "nl">Let's see what this program would look like if I created multiple instances of my employee class. I can iterate through them using the for each loop.</span></p>
    
    <em>Code:</em>
    <!-- code -->
    <pre class="code">
    class TestEmployee {
        
        public static void main(String[] args) {
        
            <span class = "comments">// Create an array of Employee objects</span>
            Employee[] E = new Employee[3];
            
            <span class = "comments">// Initialize each instance of the array</span>
            E[0] = new Employee("John", 20);
            E[1] = new Employee("Susan", 10);
            E[2] = new Employee("William", 30);
            
            <span class = "comments">// Print the results</span>
            for(Employee e : E)
                System.out.printf("name: %s, badges: %d", e.getName(), e.getBadges());
        }
    }</pre>
