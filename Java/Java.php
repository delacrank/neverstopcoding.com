    <h2>Intro to Java</h2>

        <p>Finally, a section on java. I've been wanting to learn this section for a long time.  Let's talk about Java for a moment.  It's an OOPL Object Oriented Programming Language, which means it makes the use of user defined types throught the use of classes.
    
        <span class ="nl">Java is also an intrepreted language. You can write java on multiple machines and it will always work as long as their is a JIT Just in Time java compiler. An intrepreted language means that the code is compiled and executed line by line.</span>
    
        <span class = "nl">Before we write any code, we can check to see if our machine has java compiler. To do this let's open up the terminal and type in 'java -version'.</span></p>
    
    <em>Code:</em>
    <!-- code -->
    <pre class="code">
    java -version</pre>
    
    <p>This will let you know the version of java you are running as well as the server and whether your machine is a 32 bit or a 64 bit. In order to compile code using the command line, let's type in 'javac fileName.java'.
    
    <span class = "nl">This will compile the java source file, however in order to run that executable file, we need to type in another command 'java fileName.java'.  So javac, stands for java compiler and java is the command needed to run the executable file.</span></p>
    
    <em>Code:</em>
    <!-- code -->
    <pre class="code">
    <span class = "comments">// Command line to compile  and to run</span>
    javac 'fileName.java'
    java 'fileName'</pre>
    
    <p>Let's write our first program, hello world.  All java files must be stored under a class name and that name must be the name of the file as well.  So, if we create a java file called 'test.java' then the class name for that source file must also be 'class test'.</p>
    
    <em>Code:</em>
    <!-- code -->
    <pre class="code">
    <span class = "comments">// file Test.java, must be named 'Test.java' case senstive</span>
    public class Test {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
        System.out.println("Hello, World.");
        
        }
    }</pre>
    
    <p>If we look at this code closely you will notice that we declared our class public.  Our main function was declared public as well and returns a void, which means doesn't have to return a value (in 'C' our main function returns an integer).
    
    <span class = "nl">Next, let's how we call our print function, 'System.out.println()'.  This means our function is stored in a namespace called System.out, it is also a member function.  Nearly all of the functions in 'java' are stored in these massive libraries.</span></p>
    
    <hr />
    
    <!-- packages -->
    <h3>Packages</h3>
        
    <p>We can also declare a package for a grouping of files stored in a directory. We just have to use the reserved word package and keep our files in the same name as that directory.</p>
    
    <em>Code:</em>
    <!-- code -->
    <pre class="code">
    <span class = "comments">// file Test.java</span>
    package helloworld;
    
    public class Test {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
        System.out.println("Hello, World.");
        
        }
    }</pre>
    
    <p>To run this file we need need to store it in the directory 'helloworld' and then run it from one level up.  The command line would look like this.</p>
    
    <em>Code:</em>
    <!-- code -->
    <pre class="code">
    <span class = "comments">// compile Test.java</span>
    javac helloworld/Test.java
    java helloworld/Test</pre>
