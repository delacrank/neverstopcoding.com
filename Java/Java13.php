    <h1>Superclass Object &amp; Equality Testing - Java Programming</h1>
    
    <h2>Superclass Object &amp; Equality Testing</h2>
    
        <p>In this section, we are going to learn about the 'object' that extends all classes, and how to test for equality between two classes, whether they be parent, child or otherwise.
    
    <span class = "nl">Let's look at the first subject, the 'superclass' object, and how it applies to our other classes and objects. The object type can only refer to other other class intances, it cannot refer to any primitive types.</span>
    
    <span class = "nl">Let's look at an example using our existing 'Employee' class.</span></p>
    
    <em>Code:</em>
    <!-- code -->
    <pre class="code">
    class Employee {
    
        private String name;
        private int Salary;
    
        public Employee (String name, int Salary) {
            this.name = name;
            this.Salary = Salary;
        }
        
        public void Display() {
            System.out.println("Name: " + name + " Salary: " + Salary);
        }
        
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            <span class = "comments">// We can store the Employee instance in 'type' Object</span>
            Object var = new Employee("John", 30000);
            
            <span class = "comments">// However, we cannot call any methods from using the object, Error!</span>
            var.Display();
        }
    }</pre>
    
        <p>So we can use the 'Object' type to hold values for our class instances, but we can't use the object to invoke any methods. The way to invoke methods from the object would be to first 'cast' it back to its original type.</p>
    
    <em>Code:</em>
    <!-- code -->
    <pre class="code">
    <span class = "comments">// Let's cast this object into type employee</span>
    Employee e = (Employee)var;
    
    <span class = "comments">// Now we can invoke our class method</span>
    e.Display();</pre>
    
    <hr />
    
    <!-- Equals Method -->
    <h3>Equals Method</h3>
    
        <p>We can use the 'Equals' method to test to see if the 'Object' type is equal to another 'class' type. We should be careful to check throughly that the object is in fact equal by checking the object based on its current state.</p>
    
    <em>Code:</em>
    <!-- code -->
    <pre class="code">
    <span class = "comments">// Import the lib 'Objects'</span>
    import java.util.Objects;
    
    class Employee {
    
        private String name;
        private int Salary;
        
        public Employee( String name, int Salary) {
            this.name = name;
            this.Salary = Salary;
        }
    
        public boolean equals(Object var) {
            <span class = "comments">// Check to see if Object is identical</span>
            if(this == var)
                return true;
                
            <span class = "comments">// If that suceeds, check to see if object is null</span>
            if(var == null)
                return false;
                
            <span class = "comments">// If that suceeds, check to see the 'classes' match</span>
            if(getClass() != var.getClass())
                return false;
                
            <span class = "comments">// Assign a variable to equal our Object parameter</span>   
            Employee other = (Employee)var;
                
            <span class = "comments">// If that suceeds, check to see if the fields are identical</span>
            return Objects.equals(name, other.name)
                &amp;&amp; Salary == other.Salary;
        }
    }</pre>
    
        <p>The code above will test for equality between the 'Object' type and the class you are comparing it to.  However, you might also want to check to see if the parameter is being implicitly pass vs explicitly pass. This happens when the call is made between a subclass and superclass.  In these situations we can use the 'instanceof' operator.</p>
    
    <em>Code:</em>
    <!-- code -->
    <pre class="code">
    if(!(var instanceof Employee))
        return false;</pre>
    
        <p>If we want to check equality between subclass and superclass, we can should use the 'super' modifer to call the method from our parent class.</p>
    
    <em>Code:</em>
    <!-- code -->
    <pre class="code">
    <span class = "comments">// Check to see if there belong to the same class</span>
    public boolean equals(Object var)
    {
        if(!super.equals(var))
            return false;
        
        Manager other = (Manager) var;
    
        return variable == var.variable;
    }</pre>
    
        <p>If our method is sucessful we should be able to check whether one object is equal to another. There is also another way to check whether two objects are equal and we will find out about this next, using something called the 'hashCode'.</p>
    
    <em>Code:</em>
    <!-- code -->
    <pre class="code">
    class Main {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            Employee emp = new Employee("John", 30000);
            Employee emp2 = new Employee("John", 30000);
            Employee emp3 = new Employee("Susan", 40000);

            <span class = "comments">// Compare the objects using 'equals' method</span>
            System.out.println("emp.equals(emp2): " + emp.equals(emp2));
            <span class = "comments">// Compare the objects using the comparison operator</span>
            System.out.println("emp == emp2: " + (emp == emp2));
            System.out.println("emp.equals(emp3): " + emp.equals(emp3));
        }
    }</pre>
