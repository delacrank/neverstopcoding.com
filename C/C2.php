        <h1>Boolean Operators &amp; Arrays - C Development</h1>
        
        <h2>Boolean Operators &amp; Arrays</h2>
        
            <p>The next sample program we will go over how to count complete words.  How will the program recognize the difference between a word and a character, or a space, or tab? </p>
        
        <hr />
        
        <!-- sample program -->
        <h3>If Else &amp; Boolean Operators</h3>
        
            <p>The next program is an example of using two different states in order to establish a what to count.  By setting the state to zero means that only characters and newlines will be counted. 
                
        <span class="nl">However, when the state is changed to one a word will be counted.  The only way the state can get changed to a one is when a space, tab, or newline isn't being used (in otherwise uninterrupted series of characters).</span></p>
        
    <em>Code:</em>
    <!-- code -->
    <pre class="code">
    <span class="comments">// word counter</span>
    #include &lt;stdio.h>

    #define IN 1
    #define OUT 0

    main()
    {   
        int c, nl, nw, nc, state;
    
        state = OUT;
        nl = nw = nc = 0;
        while ((c = getchar()) != EOF) {
            ++nc;
            if (c == '\n')
                ++nl ;
            if (c == ' ' || c == '\n' || c == '\t')
                state = OUT;
            else if (state == OUT) {
                state = IN;
                ++nw;
            }
        }
        printf("%d %d %d\n", nl, nw, nc);
    }    
    </pre>
        
    <p>In the example above we used an 'If Else' conditional statement to determine whether or not to count characters counting no whitespaces as words.  Yet, in order to determine which characters could be seperated from whitespace input we used a boolean operator '||' or.
        
        <span class = "nl">The <b>'or'</b> operator forced our program to choose between whitespaces and characters, if the input contained a whitespace then we would set the 'state' variable equal to zero.  However, if the input contained no whitespace the program could set the 'state' variable equal to one and count the combined characters as a word.</span></p>

    <!-- Arrays -->    
    <h3>Arrays</h3>
        
        <p>The purpose of our next program is to create an array which will count the number of integers used by digit.  We will use variables to store white space and characters.  The array we have set will store every digit from zero through nine left to right, using each magic number as a place holder for number of digits counted in the program.</p>

    #include &lt;stdio.h>
    
    main()
    {
        int c, i, nwhite, nother;
        int ndigit[10];
        
        nwhite = nother = 0;
        for (i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++)
            ndigit[i] = 0;
            
        while ((c = getchar()) != EOF)
            if (c >= '0' &amp;&amp; c &lt;= '9')
                ++ndigit[c-'0'];
            else if (c == ' ' || c == '\n' || c == '\t')
                ++nwhite;
            else
                ++nother;
                
        printf("digits = ");
        for (i = 0; i &lt; 10; ++i)
            printf(" %d", ndigit[i]);
        printf(", white space = %d, other = %d\n", nwhite, nother);
    }
    </pre>
        
    <p>Most of this code we have already gone over using are other program.  The parts that stick out are the 'int ndigit[10]' initializing the array to 10 magic numbers (0 - 9).
        
        <span class = "nl">Also we use greater than or equals sign along with the boolean 'And' operator to determine if the number is between 0 or 9.  The interesting piece of code that allows this program to add increments of one to each component of our array is this line '++ndigit[c-'0']'.  </span>
            
        <span class="nl">Using c - 0 is like setting the array's components equal to c, because any number minus zero it just itself. The rest of the code is just a repeat of our earlier programs.</span> </p>
