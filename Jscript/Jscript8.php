<h1>Javascript Manipulating Data Structures Cont.</h1>
    
    <h2>Slice, Splice, Concat</h2>
    
    <p>In this section we are going to be talking about how to merge, divide and insert into our arrays.  First an example of how to merge two arrays into a new one using the concat function.</p>
    
    <em>Code:</em>
    <!-- code -->
    <pre class="code">
    var colors = ["red", "blue", "green"];
    
    var colors2 = ["purple", "brown", "black"];
    
    <span class = "comments">// we can combine this two arrays using the concat function</span>
    var colors3 = colors.concat( colors2 );
        
    console.log(colors3.toString());</pre>
    
    <p>The way the slice function works, is by sectioning a part of the array into another variable.  Slice takes two arguments the first one: decides the index of the area in which to start, the second argument includes the amount of elements.
    
    <span class = "nl">Let's look at an exmaple of this.</span></p>
    
    <em>Code:</em>
    <!-- code -->
    <pre class="code">
    var numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9];
    
    <span class = "comments">// copy these elements into this array starting at the first element ending on the fifth</span>
    var numbers2 = numbers.slice(0, 5);

    console.log(numbers2.toString()); </pre>
    
    <p>Now, let's look at another function, this function is called splice and it works differently then slice. Splice works by actually taking elements from one array and moving them into another one. If another array isn't provided then the elements are just deleted.</p>
    
    <em>Code:</em>
    <!-- code -->
    <pre class="code">
    var numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9];
    
    <span class = "comments">// divide the array into arrays starting at the first element ending on the fifth</span>
    var numbers2 = numbers.splice(0, 5);

    <span class="comments">// let's see how the two arrays look now</span>
    console.log(numbers.toString());
    console.log(numbers2.toString()); 
    
    <span class = "comments">// or we can just delete the first three numbers</span>
    numbers2.splice(0, 3);
    
    console.log(numbers2.toString()); </pre>
    
    <p>There is also a third feature of the splice function which is the third argument. This third argument inserts data into the array.  Let's look at an example of this.</p>
    
    <em>Code:</em>
    <em>Code:</em>
    <!-- code -->
    <pre class="code">
    var colors = ["red", "blue", "green"];
    
    <span class ="comments">// start at index 1, remove zero elements, add these colors</span>
    colors.splice(1, 0, "brown", "yellow");
    
    console.log(colors.toString());</pre>
    
    <p>Using this method, we can insert data directly into an array or we can replace elements as well. </p>
    
    <em>Code:</em>
    <!-- code -->
    <pre class="code">
    var numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9];
    
    <span class = "comments">// replace these words with these colors</span>
    numbers.splice(3, 3, "four", "five", "six");
    
    console.log(numbers.toString());</pre>
    
    <p>In our next time we will go over using datetimes and regular expressions.</p>
