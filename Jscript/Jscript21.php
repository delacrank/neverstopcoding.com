<h1>Javascript - Understanding the BOM</h1>

    <p>The BOM stands for the browser object model, later we will also talk about the DOM (document object model).  Developers use functions of the BOM to primarily address issues related to running code on different browsers like: firefox, chrome, internet explorer etc.
    
    <span class = "nl">Let's investigate some of the functions built into the BOM and how we can use them in our web applications.</span></p>
    
<hr />
    
<h2>Window Object</h2>
    
    <p>This section will refer to some of the properties we can use to find the size and the location of the browser window.  There will also be a section for functions we can use to change the size and location, or open and close a new window as necessary.</p>
    
<hr />
    
<h3>Window Location and Size</h3>
    
    <p>The window class is basically a global class, this means that functions or variables declared here can be called from any other global scope. We can use the window object to determine the position of the window, the size of it, open a new window, close the current one, resize or move it.
    
    <span class = "nl">Let's look at some examples of this.</span></p>
    
    <em>Code:</em>
    <!-- code -->
    <pre class="code">
    <span class = "comments">// determine the x coordinate of the window</span>
    var leftPos = (typeof window.screenLeft == “number”) ? 
    window.screenLeft : window.screenX;
    
    <span class = "comments">// determine the y coordinate of the window</span>
    var topPos = (typeof window.screenTop == “number”) ? 
    window.screenTop : window.screenY;
    
    <span class = "comments">// for chrome</span>
    var x = window.screenLeft;
    
    <span class = "comments">// for firefox</span>
    var x = window.screenX;</pre>
    
    <p>One of the reasons for use the ternany statement is the differences in browsers: firefox requires the screenX / screenY properties of the window object, while Chrome, IE and Safari require the screenLeft and screenTop properties.
        
    <span class = "nl">The screen coordinates let us know the location of the browser window but not its actual size.  This once again varies based on the browser, let's look at some of the options available to us for finding the values of the inner and outer windows of the browser. There are also properties for finding the viewport of our browser object using 'document.documentElement.' : 'clientHeight' or 'clientWidth'.</span></p>
    
    <em>Code:</em>
    <!-- code -->
    <pre class="code">
    <span class = "comments">// display the inner width for the browser window</span>
    var innerPageWidth = window.innerWidth;
    
    <span class = "comments">// display the inner height for the browser window</span>
    var innerPageHeight = window.innerHeight;
    
    <span class = "comments">// display the outer width for the browser window</span>
    var outerPageWidth = window.outerWidth;
    
    <span class = "comments">// display the outer height for the browser window</span>
    var outerPageHeight = window.outerHeight;
    
    <span class = "comments">// display the width for the browser viewport</span>
    var pageWidth = document.documentElement.clientWidth;
    
    <span class = "comments">// display the height for the browser viewport</span>
    var pageHeight = document.documentElement.clientHeight;
    
    <span class = "comments">// print out the lengths of each width and height</span>
    console.log(innerPageWidth, innerPageHeight, 
    outerPageWidth, outerPageHeight, pageWidth, pageHeight);</pre>
    
    <hr />
    
    <h3>Resizing and Moving the Browser</h3>
    
    <p><span class = "nl">Now that we have an idea of how to pass the x and y coordinates to our application, let's see how we can open a new window, resize it and/or move it around the screen.</span></p>
    
    <em>Code:</em>
    <!-- code -->
    <pre class="code">
    <span class = "comments">// start by openning a new window</span>
    var w = window.open("http://www.google.com", "", "height=250,width=250");</pre>
    
    <p>The first argument refers to the URL of the site, the second argument refers to the actual location of the window, if its a frame ('frame name') or a new tab ('_blank') or the same window ('_self'). 
    
    <span class = "nl">The rest of the arguments refer to the: height, width, y coordinate, x coordinate and whether or not its resizable.</span>
        
    <span class = "nl">Let's open another window this time let's use all of the arguments. We can also use this as an opportunity to test other functions which resize and move the new window around.</span></p>
    
    <em>Code:</em>
    <!-- code -->
    <pre class="code">
    <span class = "comments">// the variable is a pointer to the window object</span>
    var w = window.open("http://www.youtube.com"," ",
    "height=400,width=400,top=10,left=10,resizable=yes");
    
    <span class = "comments">// move the window to these coordinates</span>
    w.moveTo(600,600);
    
    <span class = "comments">// let's resize it to make it smaller</span>
    w.resizeTo(250,250);</pre>
    
    <p>A few other functions for the window object are moveBy(x, y), or resizeBy(x, y) and negative or positive values can be used to increase/decrease the size of the window or determine whether the window is moving down and right (positive values) or up and left (negative values).
    
    <span class = "nl">To close the window, simply type the pointer and call the close function. If you want to free up memory for the variable and disallow further access to that window in the script you can use the opener function.</span></p>
    
    <em>Code:</em>
    <!-- code -->
    <pre class="code">
    <span class = "comments">// open a new window in fullscreen</span>
    var w = window.open("http://www.gmail.com", "email", "fullscreen=yes");
    
    <span class = "comments">// close that window</span>
    w.close();
    
    <span class = "comments">// you can check to see if the property was closed</span>
    console.log(w.closed);
    
    <span class = "comments">// sever the connection</span>
    w.opener = null;</pre>    
    
    <p>In our next section we are going to talk about using interval timers and system dialogs.</p>
