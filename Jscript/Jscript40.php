<h1>Javascript - Ajax</h1>
    
    <p>Ajax stands for Asynchronous JavaScript And XML, asynchronous means two or more events happening at the same time and xml stands for extensible markup language.  Initially created by microsoft and eventually adopted by other browsers, this technology became named ajax in 2006. </p>
    
<hr />    
    
<h2>XMLHttpRequest</h2>
 
    <p>The way Ajax works is by checking the server to see if the xml request was sent and received before taking further action.  This is most commonly used when making calls to a server (i.e. database query) and then having to reload the page in order to see if the request was successful.
    
    <span class = "nl">Using Ajax users can use this protocal to check if the request was successful without having to reload the page.  So let's look at some code now.</span></p>
    
    <em>Code:</em>
    <!-- code -->
    <pre class="code">
    <span class='comments'>// create an instance of the object</span>
    var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
    
    <span class = 'comments'>// prepare type of request to be sent</span>
    <span class = 'comments'>// type of request, url, async or not</span>
    xhr.open('get', 'test.php', false);
    
    <span class = 'comments'>// use send method to sent the request</span>
    xhr.send(null); </pre>
    
    <p>So far we have went over how to create an instance of the XMLHttpRequest class, set the parameters for the request and then send the request.  Next this object will be populated with four properties which determine the status, text, xml, and statusText.
    
    <span class = "nl">Let's continue with the first example expanding to include the response this time.</span></p>
    
    <em>Code:</em>
    <!-- code -->
    <pre class="code">
    var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
    xhr.open('get', 'test.php', false);
    xhr.send(null); 
    
    <span class = "comments">// only status of sucessful request 200 or lower</span>
    <span class = "comments">// 300 and 304 are also considered successful responses</span>
    if ((xhr.status >= 200 &amp;&amp; xhr.status &lt; 300) || xhr.status == 304){
        <span class = "comments">// display the response</span>
       alert(xhr.responseText);
    } else {
        <span class = "comments">// display reason for failure</span>
        alert(“Request was unsuccessful: “ + xhr.status);
    }</pre>
    
    <p>Let's take a look into use the readyState property. The readyState is a property which will return a series of numbers each determining the current state of the response. </p>
    
    <ul class='li'>
        <li><b>0 :</b> Uninitialized. The open() method hasn’t been called yet.
        <li><b>1 :</b> Open. The open() method has been called but send() has not been called.
        <li><b>2 :</b> Sent. The send() method has been called but no response has been received.
        <li><b>3 :</b> Receiving. Some response data has been retrieved.
        <li><b>4 :</b> Complete. All of the response data has been retrieved and is available.
    </ul>
    
    <p>Now that we have an idea of what each state does, let's look at an example attaching an event to our object in order to have it response to a request. </p>
    
    <em>Code:</em>
    <!-- code -->
    <pre class="code">
    var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest(); 
    
    <span class = "comments">// attach the readystatechange event to our object</span>
    xhr.onreadystatechange = function() {
        <span class = "comments">// detect if the request is sent and received</span>
        if (xhr.readyState == 4) {
            <span class = "comments">// display reponse</span>
            if ((xhr.status >= 200 &amp;&amp; xhr.status &lt; 300) || xhr.status == 304) {
                alert(xhr.responseText); 
            } else {
                alert(“Request was unsuccessful: “ + xhr.status); 
            }
        }
    };
    
    xhr.open(“get”, “example.txt”, true); 
    <span class = "comments">// should trigger our event now</span>
    xhr.send(null);</pre>
    
    <p>There is also the option of using the 'abort' method in case the request fails or for error handling. 'xhr.abort()'.</p>
