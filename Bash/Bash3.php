        <h1>Learning Bash Shell</h1>

	<h2>Creating bash scripts</h2>

	<p>In order to create a script in the bourne again shell, you simply need to create the file and give it the file extension of .sh. You also need to provide the shell script with a location in order to find the binaries to run it. This is done with a shebang followed by the bin folder and the name of the shell commands.

	  <span class = "nl">Below is an example.</span></p>

<em>Bash script:</em>
<pre class = "code"><span class = "comments"># hello_world.sh</span>
!#/bin/bash

echo "hello world"</pre>

<p>If you are running this shell script on a windows machine I would suggest using the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cygwin.com">cywin</a> tool to run unix commands on your machine and using the 'bash' program to execute it as well. You will probably also need to download the <a href="https://waterlan.home.xs4all.nl/dos2unix.html" target="_blank">dos2unix</a> tool as well to convert your file endings to the run using the bash command.</p>

<em>cmdline:</em>
<pre class = "code"><span class = "comments"># dollar sign means command prompt</span>
$ bash hello_world.sh</pre>

<hr />

<h2>Variables and expressions</h2>

<p>The bash shell comes equipped with tools to perform some computations as well as setting variables. Below is an example of doing some of these actions.</p>
			       
<em>Math:</em>
<pre class = "code">#!/bin/bash

<span class = "comments"># declare a constant</span>  
declare -r NUM1=5

<span class = "comments"># declare a regular variable</span>
num2=4

num3=$((NUM1+num2))
num4=$((NUM1-num2))
num5=$((NUM1*num2))
num6=$((NUM1/num2))

<span class = "comments"># display the values</span>
echo $num3
echo $num4
echo $num5
echo $num6</pre>

	<p>You can also use exponents like this '$(( 5**2 ))' which will square 5 and modulus operator like this '$(( 6%2 ))'. In the next section we will go over how to use functions.</p>
