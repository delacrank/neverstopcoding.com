        <h1>Joins Part 2 - MySQL Relational Database</h1>
        
        <h2>Joins Cont.</h2>
        
            <p>In this section we are going to continue talking about joins and the different types of joins we can use.  We can join tables using an inner join or outer join and we can join more than two tables. <br /><br />
                
        However, in order to perform some of these joins we need a matching column in both tables, this is where foreign keys are useful. For our next example I am going to add a foreign key to an existing table.</p>
        
        <hr />
        
       <h3>Adding a foreign key to an existing table</h3>
        
            <p>In order for us to set a foreign key in an existing table we need to create a column which has the same name as its primary key.</p>
        
        <em>Code:</em>
        <!-- code -->
        <pre class="code">
        ALTER TABLE shoes ADD cust_id INT(2) UNSIGNED NOT NULL;</pre>
        
        <p>Following this we can just update the values in our new row to the values equal to those of our primary key in the other table.</p>
        
        <em>Code:</em>
        <!-- code -->
        <pre class="code">
        UPDATE shoes SET cust_id = 1 where shoe_id = 1;
        UPDATE shoes SET cust_id = 2 where shoe_id = 2;
        UPDATE shoes SET cust_id = 3 where shoe_id = 3;
        UPDATE shoes SET cust_id = 4 where shoe_id = 4;
        UPDATE shoes SET cust_id = 5 where shoe_id = 5;
        UPDATE shoes SET cust_id = 6 where shoe_id = 6;
        UPDATE shoes SET cust_id = 7 where shoe_id = 7;
        UPDATE shoes SET cust_id = 8 where shoe_id = 8;</pre>
        
        <p>I am sure there are ways to update multiple rows in one column but I am not going to focus trying to teach that for the purpose of adding our foreign key.<br /><br /> 
        
        If you added the column and set the rows to the correct values than all there is left to do is add our foreign key.</p>
        
        <em>Code:</em>
        <!-- code -->
        <pre class="code">
        ALTER TABLE shoes ADD FOREIGN KEY (cust_id) REFERENCES customers (cust_id);</pre><br />
        
        <img src="../Images/Add%20fk.png" title="ALTER TABLE shoes ADD FOREIGN KEY (cust_id) REFERENCES customers(cust_id);" alt ="ALTER TABLE shoes ADD FOREIGN KEY (cust_id) REFERENCES customers(cust_id);"/>
        
        <hr />
        
        <!-- Inner Join -->
        <h3>Inner Join</h3>
        
            <p>Alright now we can perform our inner join being that we have two tables which have a matching column.</p>
        
        <em>Code:</em>
        <!-- Code -->
        <pre class="code">
        SELECT * FROM customers INNER JOIN shoes USING (cust_id);</pre><br />
        <img src="../Images/Inner%20join2.png" title="SELECT * FROM customers INNER JOIN shoes USING (cust_id);" alt = "SELECT * FROM customers INNER JOIN shoes USING (cust_id);"/>
