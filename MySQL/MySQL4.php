        <h1>Conditionals - MySQL Relational Database</h1>
        
        <h2>Using Conditionals</h2>
        
            <p>In the our last section we breifly touched on using the 'WHERE' clause in order to select certain records within our table.  This 'WHERE' clause can be used in combination with a 'CONDITIONAL'. 
            
        <span class = "nl">Below, I will show a list of conditionals and go over a few examples of how you would use them.</span></p>
        
        <ul class = "li">
            <li><b>= Equals:</b> Used when you want to find a record with the value equal to the one used in the where clause.</li>
            <li><b>&lt; Less than:</b> For records with the value less than the one stated.</li>
            <li><b>> Greater then:</b> For records with the value greater than the one stated.</li>
            <li><b>&lt;= Less than or equal to:</b> Less then or equal to the value stated.</li>
            <li><b>>= Greater then or equal to:</b> Greater then or equal to the value stated.</li>
            <li><b>!= Not equal to:</b> All values not equal to the one stated.</li>
            <li><b>Is not null:</b> Any record which contains a value in the table.</li>
            <li><b>Is null:</b> Any record which does not contain a value.</li>
            <li><b>Is True:</b> Any record which contains a true value.</li>
            <li><b>Is False:</b> Has a false value.</li>
            <li><b>Between:</b> Used for a range of values between two sets of values.</li>
            <li><b>Not Between:</b> Used for records outside of the range between two values.</li>
            <li><b>|| Or:</b> Where at least one of the values is true.</li>
            <li><b>&amp;&amp; And:</b> Both values must be true.</li>
            <li><b>! Not:</b> Where the condition is not true.</li>
            <li><b>XOR:</b> Where only one of the conditions is true.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Alright, let's write some more queries which make use of some of these conditionals.</p>
        
        
    <em>Code:</em>
    <!-- Code -->
    <pre class="code">
    SELECT id, first_name, last_name FROM Login WHERE id &lt; 5;</pre>
        
    <br />    
    <img src="../Images/DBlt4.png" title="SELECT id, first_name, last_name FROM Login WHERE id < 5;" alt = "SELECT id, first_name, last_name FROM Login WHERE id < 5;"/>    
        
        <p>Great, our query went into our Login Table and only selected entries whose 'id' field was less than the number 5. Now let's narrow it down a little more by using our AND conditional.</p>
        
    <em>Code:</em>
    <!-- Code -->
    <pre class="code">
    SELECT id, first_name, last_name FROM Login WHERE id &lt; 5
    AND first_name LIKE 'J%';</pre>
        
    <br />    
    <img src="../Images/DBAND.png"  title="SELECT id, first_name, last_name FROM Login WHERE id < 5 AND first_name LIKE 'J%';" alt = "SELECT id, first_name, last_name FROM Login WHERE id < 5;" />    
        
    <p>Here we used 2 existing queries, the first one being our 'LIKE %J' query which selected records based on users whose first name begin with the letter J.  Additionally, we used our second query which selected users whose 'id' field was less than 5. 

        <span class = "nl">From both those queries only 2 entries could be selected.</span></p>
        
        <hr />
        
        <!-- Sorting -->
        <h3>Sorting data</h3>
        
            <p>I could continue to write more queries if I wanted to, however there are many resources online which can show you the many of the possible queries you can write using SQL.<br /><br />
        
        This next section will focus on sorting data, whether it be alphabetically, or numerically.  There are two types of orders which we can sort by ascending (top to bottom) or descending (bottom to top).</p>
        
    <em>Code:</em>
    <!-- Code -->
    <pre class="code">
    SELECT id, first_name, last_name FROM Login ORDER BY first_name;</pre>
    <br />    
    <img src="../Images/DBOrderby.png"  title="SELECT id, first_name, last_name FROM Login ORDER BY first_name;" alt = "SELECT id, first_name, last_name FROM Login ORDER BY first_name;" />    
        
        <p>Here you can clearly see that the order of the field name id has been changed in order to accomdate the alphabetically listing of each users first name.  By default the 'ORDER BY' sorting value will always been ascending (top to bottom) if we want to change that order we can use descending or 'DESC'.</p>
        
    <em>Code:</em>
    <!-- Code -->
    <pre class="code">
    SELECT id, first_name, last_name FROM Login ORDER BY first_name DESC;</pre>
    <br />    
    <img src="../Images/DBDESC.png"  title="SELECT id, first_name, last_name FROM Login ORDER BY first_name DESC;" alt = "SELECT id, first_name, last_name FROM Login ORDER BY first_name DESC;" />
