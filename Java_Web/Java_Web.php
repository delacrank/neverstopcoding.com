  <h2>Setting up Java Enviroment</h2>

  <p>In this section we are going to get into how to create web applications using the java programming language. Things to note, in order to run any of these programs you will need the java programming language. To check to see if it is already installed in your machine open the command line and type in 'java -version'. If you are using a windows machine I suggest adding the binaries for java in your enviroment variables (path).

   <span class = "nl">To check if it is already in your path type in 'echo %JAVA_HOME%', if it isn't right click 'MyComputer' -> select 'advanced system settings' -> 'advanced tab' then click the button called 'Enviroment Variables'. Select the Variable called path and append the binary folder for Java to the end of your path variable ('Program_Files/Java/jdk-version_num/bin').</span>

   <span class = "nl">Next you will need a tomcat server. Just visit the Apache Tomcat webpage download the server, store the folder in your C:\ drive or Create a Tomcat folder for your unix/linux distro and place it there. In order to start or stop the server you will need to navigate to the 'Tomcat' directory and the binaries folder in your command line. Then type in 'startup' to get it running or 'shutdown' to stop the service. You will be able to check if the service is working by typing in 'localhost:8080' in your web browser.</span></p>

  <em>Running Tomcat:</em>
  <!-- Code -->
  <pre class="code"><span class = 'comments'>// navigate to 'Tomcat 8.5/bin' in cmd line</span>
<span class = 'comments'>// type in</span>
startup</pre>

  <p>The next thing you want to be able to do is know where you can place files in your tomcat server to get them to run. The first type of file we will be working with is called a servlet. There is a simpler way to compile and run these programs using an IDE called eclipse but for the purposes of learning we will be doing everything by hand and command line.

    <span class = "nl">If you navigate to your tomcat folder there will be another folder called webapps, you can either place your source folder in the webapps directory or using a compress file called a .war. This .war file is probably better for deployment purposes. In order to create a .war file you need to first get all your files and folders in order before executing this command.</span></p>

  <em>Deployment:</em>
  <!-- Code -->
  <pre class="code"><span class = 'comments'>// compress folder into a .war file</span>
<span class = 'comments'>// navigate to the directory in the command line</span>
jar -cvf name.war directory-name</pre>  

  <p>Where the .war name is called name, you can name it whatever you want thou, preferably the name of the directory and the ddirectory name is where you placed all your source files. From now on you can just copy this .war file into your webapps directory and delete it when you want to deploy another application.

    <span class ="nl">Let's take a final look at actually creating the directory structure for our application. Since its our first program we will only need a few items.</p>

  <em>Deployment:</em>
  <!-- Code -->
<pre class="code">Directory_name
&#9492;&#9472;&#9472;WEB-INF\
         &#9500;&#9472;&#9472;web.xml
         &#9492;&#9472;&#9472;classes\
                  &#9492;&#9472;&#9472;Hello_World.java</pre>

  <h2>Setup Using Maven</h2>

  <p>The first thing you should know about maven is that it is a build tool. We will use these for handling dependencies, classes which required other classes in order to run. Go to the maven <a target="_blank" href="https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi">site</a>. From here you should extract the zip file and add its binaries to your path (environment variables).

<span class = "nl">To see if it worked open your terminal and type in mvn -v. </span></p>

<em>cmdline maven:</em>
<pre class = "code">mvn -v</pre>

<p>If everything worked you can create a new director 'mkdir name' and change directories into that one you just created. Then run mvn archetype:generate. From here you will have the option of determining the version of maven to use, the groupId, artifactId, version and package name.

<span class = "nl">Since we are creating a web application I suggest using the 'org.maven-maven.archetypes:maven-archetype-webapp'. It will prompt from the version number, go with the default or the newest version. Then it will ask for groupId, you can use 'com.name' (use the name you want). Following this it will prompt for artifactId which can be the project name, version should be the default 1.0-SNAPSHOT, and package can be default as well.</span></p>

<em>cmdline maven:</em>
<pre class = "code">mvn archetype:generate
<span class = "comments">Choose number: # 1469</span>
<span class = "comments">archetype version: # default</span>
<span class = "comments">groupId: # com.name</span>
<span class = "comments">version: # default (1.0-SNAPSHOT)</span>
<span class = "comments">package: # default (com.name)</span></pre>

<p>From here you can change directories into the directory which maven just created for you. There should be a src folder and a pom.xml file. Below, I will display the contents if you recursively display the contents of the directory created.</p>

<em>Directory Structure</em>
<pre class = "code">demoMVC
&#9500;&#9472;&#9472;pom.xml
&#9492;&#9472;&#9472;src\
         &#9492;&#9472;&#9472;main\
                  &#9492;&#9472;&#9472;webapp\
                           &#9500;&#9472;&#9472index.jsp
                           &#9492;&#9472;&#9472;WEB-INF\
                                    &#9492;&#9472;&#9472;web.xml</pre>

<p>The next steps require you to compile and then package your application. Look below for the commands in order to execute your next steps.</p>


<em>cmdline maven:</em>
<pre class = "code">mvn compile</pre>
  
<p>After compiling your classes you just need to package them. For that you can just run mvn package in order to generate your jar file or war file. In the sitaution where you package a war file then I would suggest that you place that file in your tomcat server under webapps. It should unpack itself, otherwise you can also deploy it using the manager gui.</p>

<em>cmdline maven:</em>
<pre class = "code">mvn package</pre>

<p>In the situation where you add dependencies to the pom.xml file and you wish to redeploy your application you need to recompile and then package it again. If you are using the el syntax (expression language ${}) then I would suggest changing the automatically configured web.xml file which is created when you run mvn package. </p>

<em>Code:</em>
<pre class = "code">&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
&lt;web-app xmlns="http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/javaee"
         xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
         xsi:schemaLocation="http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/javaee
                             http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/javaee/web-app_3_1.xsd"
         version="3.1">
&lt;/web-app></pre>
