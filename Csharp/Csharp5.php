<h1>Objects and Classes Cont. - Learning C#</h1>
    
<h2>Objects and Classes Cont.</h2>
    
    <p>In this section, we will talk about using: constructors, inhertiance, structures, interfaces.</p>
    
<hr />
    
<!-- Constructors -->
<h3>Constructors</h3>
    
    <p>  A constructor is a special type of method that runs automatically when you create an instance of a class.  It will contain the same name as the class and even take parameters but cannot return a value.  </p>
    
<em>Code:</em>
<!-- code -->
<pre class="code">
class Math
{ 
    private int number;
    
    public Math() <span class="comments">// default Constructor </span>
    { 
        number = 0;
    } 
    
    public double Square()
    { 
        return number * number
        
    }
}</pre>
    
    <p>If we want to use are Sqaure method, we simply need to create a Math object and invoke the class using the '.' notation.</p>
    
<em>Code:</em>
<!-- code -->
<pre class="code">
Math m;
m = new Math();
double squaredNumber = m<span class="highlight">.</span>Square();</pre>  
    
<p>Alright, so finally we have a constructor which can initialize the value of a variable and we can use this variable in other methods (such as: square method).
    
    <span class ="nl">The only problem is that we initialized the variable to zero.  In the next example below, I will show you how to solve this problem by overloading your constructor.</p>
    
<em>Code:</em>
<!-- code -->
<pre class="code">
class Math
{
    private int number;
    
    public <span class="highlight4">Math</span>() 
    { 
        number = 0;
    } 
    
    public <span class="highlight4">Math</span>(int <span class="highlight">initialNumber</span>)
    { 
        number = <span class="highlight">initalNumber</span>;
    } 
    
    public double Square()
    {
        return number * number
    }
}</pre>
    
    <p>In the example above, we created two constructor methods only one of them has parameters, so the compiler will be able to dectect which one to used based on the number of arguements in the constructor method when we call it.
        
        <span class = "nl">Let's use are method this time, only let's pass some arguements to it using are overloaded constructor variable 'initalNumber'.</span></p>
    
<em>Code:</em>
<!-- code -->
<pre class="code">
Math m;
m = new <span class="highlight4">Math</span>(<span class="highlight">8</span>);</pre>
    
<p>We have just managed to initialized a private class variable outside of the class by using a constructor method.
    
    <span class = "nl">This saves us time and writing unnecessary variables in our 'Main' method, we won't have to depend heavily on variables we create in our 'Main' method when we can just initialize them in the class using a constructor. </p>
    
<hr />
    
<!-- Partial Classes -->
<h3>Partial Classes</h3>

    <p>Classes can contain a large number of methods, fields and constructors.  Some of these classes can become so large that you might want to split the code into separate files in order to organize it into smaller easier pieces.</p>
    
<hr />
        
<!-- Structures -->
<h3>Structures</h3>

     <p>Structures can also store variables and methods like classes.  However, the two differ because a class is a reference type whereas a structure is a value type.  References are stored on the heap and values are stored on the stack, once classes are done being used there is a lot of excess memory be used to store those references. 
         
         <span class = "nl">Another difference between the two is that reference types will copy the reference and not the value (unless we specify otherwise by using 'ref' or 'out' parameters). When creating a structure which is a value type, the value will be passed instead of the reference.  This can be convenient due to not having to unbox any objects afterwards. However, be careful when using structures as variables cannot be initialized inside a structure.</span></p>
         
<em>Structure:</em>
<!-- code -->
<pre class="code">
public struct MyStruct
{
    public int i;
}

public static void Main()
{
    MyStruct ms;
    ms.i = 10;
}</pre>

<br />
<hr />
    
<!-- Interface -->
<h3>Interface</h3>

    <p>An interface is a place to store functions or methods.  It cannot hold fields or handle access modifiers. </p>
    
<em>Interface</em>
<!-- Code -->
<pre class="code">
public interface Car
{
    void Start();
}</pre>

<br />
<hr />
    
<!-- Inheritance -->
<h3>Inheritance</h3>

     <p>Inheritance is when you declare a class and you want another class to inherit the methods or variables of the parent class.</p>
    
<em>Inheritance</em>
<!-- Code Inheritance -->
<pre class="code">
public class Car
{
    void Start();
}

public class ChildCar : Car
{
    <span class="comments">// inherits the start function from class Car</span>
}</pre>
