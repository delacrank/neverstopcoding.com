    <p>Application file, adding code to our class file.</p>
    
<!-- Application file -->
<h3>Application file</h3>
    
    <p>
    So far, we've learned about the two different files in our GUI application.  However, there are three files in total, one to handle the look (frontend - markup), one to handle the functionality (backend - source code) and one to tell the computer where to start up the program (entry point).
    </p>
    
<!-- Markup -->
<em>MarkUp:</em>
<div class="markup">
&#60;Application x:Class="Hello.App"
<div class="padding">
   xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation"<br />
xmlns:x="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml"<br />
    StarupUri="MainWindow.xaml"></div>
&#60;Application.Resources><br /><br />
&#60;/Application.Resources><br />
&#60;/Application>
</div>
    
<p>Now our program knows where to go everytime a user opens up our program (which class to access, etc.).</p>
    
<!-- Button Method -->
<h3>Button Method</h3>
    
    <p>
    When we created our button in the xaml form, remeber:
    </p>
    
<em>Markup:</em>
<div class="markup">
&#60;Button Content="Ok" HorizontalAlignment="Left" Margin="159,32,0,0" VerticalAlignment="Top" Width="75"/>    
</div>
    
    <p>We told the program how to make it look, what it should say, where it should be located but not what it should do.<br /><br />On visual studio, if you click the button and look at its properties, you should see a lightling bolt.  This is called an event handler, if you double click on the button itself, it will take you to the method for the button.<br /><br />Let's type some code in this button method, but first let's analyze the code that pops up.</p>
    
<!-- Code -->    
<em>Code:</em>
<div class="code">
private void Button(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e) <br />
{ <br /><br />

}
</div>
    
<dl>
    <dt>Private (abstraction)</dt>
    <dd>First thing we see is the word 'private', this deals with data abstraction, it conceals the method so that a user cannot change it by accident.</dd>
    <dt>Void</dt>
<dd>Putting the word void before a method, ensures that the method will not have to return a value or require a parameter</dd>
        <dt>Button</dt>
<dd>This is just the name of the method given by default and can be changed in the event handler properties via the form.</dd>
        <dt>Object sender</dt>
<dd>Object sender simply implies what it states, for our button method the object sender is the button itself, because it is the object which is sending information.</dd>
    <dt>RoutedEventArgs e</dt>
<dd>RoutedEventArgs deals with the data of a routed event.  An event can be like the click of a mouse or a keyboard, or the movement of an object to a certain location. There are also things which handle events and can tell the computer to perform an action in response to an event.  For our button event it will tell the computer to display a message box.  A 'publisher' is something which creates an event and a 'subscriber' is something which handles an event.</dd>
</dl>
 

<p>Alright now let's add some code to our method.</p>
    
<!-- Code -->    
<em>Code:</em>
<div class="code">
private void Button(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e) <br />
{ <div class ="padding">
  MessageBox.Show("Hello " + userName.Text);
  </div>
}
</div>
    
<p>
Notice how we are accessing classes via namespaces.  MessageBox is a class in the Show namepsace, and we used the Text namespace to display our userName.
