<!-- Adding Code to our program -->
<h2>Providing functionality for our form</h2>
    
    <p>
    In this section, we will learn how to provide funcationality to our forms so that they not only look nice, but that they can also perform tasks necessary to fulfill their purpose.
    </p>
    
<!-- Xaml.cs -->
<h3>Xaml.cs</h3>
    
    <p>
    If you have created a WPF application, two files should have have accompanied the project: a xaml file and the class for that file.  In section will be focusing on the class file or the backend of our xaml application. <br /><br />Below is the basic template for this file.
    </p>
    
    
<!-- Code -->
<em>Code:</em>
<div class="code">
using System; <br />
using System.Collections.Generic; <br />
using System.Linq; <br />
using System.Text; <br />
using System.Windows; <br />
using System.Windows.Controls; <br />
using System.Windows.Data; <br />
using System.Windows.Documents; <br />
using System.Windows.Input; <br />
using System.Windows.Media; <br />
using System.Windows.Media.Imaging; <br />
using System.Windows.Navigation; <br />
using System.Windows.Shapes; <br /><br />

namespace Test2 <br />
{ 
    <div class="padding"><span class="comments">
    /// Interaction logic for MainWindow.xaml</span> <br />
    public partial class MainWindow : Window <br />
    { 
    <div class="padding">
        public MainWindow()<br />
        {
        <div class="padding">
            InitializeComponent(); </div>
            } </div>
        } </div>
}
</div>
    
    <p>
        On the top you will notice quite a few directives, thirteen in total, four basic directives for most Csharp applications and nine more for using our windowed interface (hence the .Windows namespace). <br /><br />Let's take a look at our class and its constructer. First we have included our class in a namespace 'Test2' because, we will be using that class for handling actions in our Test2 application.<br /><br />We named this class MainWindow however, let's take a better look at this next line of code because, frankly it is complicated and understanding it will help us out greatly in the near future.</p>
    
<!-- code -->
<em>Code:</em>
<div class="code">
public partial class MainWindow : Window
</div>
    
<dl>
<dt>Public (Abstraction)</dt>
    <dd>Public, this means that variables and methods declared in this class can be accessed by users as appose to 'Private' classes which are hidden and can only be accessed by the developer or someone with 'priviledges/rights'. </dd>
<dt>Partial </dt>
    <dd>Partial, this means that this perticular class is only part of a class and will eventually merge with its other sections during compile time. Csharp gives you the ability to split classes using the partial modifer. See <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/wa80x488.aspx">Partial Classes (msdn)</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_(computer_programming)#Partial">Partial Classes (wiki)</a> for more information.</dd>
<dt>MainWindow : Window (Inhertiance)</dt>
    <dd>Using the colon inbetween MainWindow and Window means that we want our MainWindow method to inherit attributes from our Window method/class.</dd>
</dl>
  
<p>
Alright, moving forward. Let's look at the next method.
</p>
    
<!-- code -->    
<em>Code:</em>
<div class="code">
public MainWindow()
</div>
    
<p>
This is our constructor.  You will know it is the constructor because, it uses the same name as the class and it will run when an instance of the class is created.  This constructor will contain code which, can initialize the instance of the class.<br /><br />For the purposes of our application, it will be to initialize the button component for our Xaml form. <br /><br />Let's take a look at the method within our contructor.
</p>
    
<!-- code -->
<em>Code:</em>
<div class="code">
InitializeComponent();
</div>
    
<p>
This method will call the 'initializeComponent' method which: creates, displays, and positions the form along with the its various controls.
