<h2>Enumerations and Structures</h2>
    
    <p>In this section, we are going to be talking about enumerations and structures.</p>
    
<hr />
    
<!-- Enumerations -->
<h3>What is an Enumeration?</h3>
    
    <p>An enumeration is a context in which to store ideas, its works very similar to an array where elements are stored starting by zero.  Below, I will create an enumeration for colors.  </p>
    
<em>Code:</em>
<!-- code -->
<pre class="code">
using System;

namespace Parameters
{
    enum Color { red, green, blue }
    
    class Pass
    { 
        public static void Main()
        { 
            Color x = Color.blue;
            Console.WriteLine(x);
        }
    }
}</pre>
    
<p>Even thou, our console wrote out the color blue, it is still referring to our enum value as being the number two, because it was the third element in our enum declaration.
    
    <span class = "nl">Let's see if we can convert our enum value to a string, using a function.</span></p>
    
<em>Code:</em>
<!-- code -->
<pre class="code">
string name = x.ToString(); 
Console.WriteLine(x);
Console.WriteLine((int)x);</pre>
    
<p>We also have the power to explicitly change the value of our enumerations by initializing our enum values.</p>
    
<em>Code:</em>
<!-- code -->
<pre class="code">
using System;

namespace Parameters
{
    enum Color { red = 2, green, blue }

    class Pass
    {
        public static void Main()
        { 
            Color x = Color.blue;
            Console.WriteLine((int)x);
        }
    }
}</pre>
    
<p>Can you guess the which value will be displayed by out console output?
    
    <span class = "nl">It was four, because we initialized the first element equal to two, so the next one will be three and so on and so forth.</span>
    
    <span class = "nl">Changing the data type of enum value.</span></p>

<em>Code:</em>
<!-- code -->
<pre class="code">
enum Color <span class="highlight">:</span> short { red, green, blue }</pre> 
    
<p>It is also possible to convert the data type of our enum values as along as we keep them numbers, so changing our elements to contain any other whole number data type will work.</p>

<hr />
    
<!-- Structures -->
<h3>Structures</h3>
    
    <p>A structure is similar to a class, where it can hold data types and methods, the main difference is that a structure can be stored on the stack where a class has to be stored on the heap.
        
        <span class = "nl">It is for this reason that using a structure requires far less overhead in terms of memory, and can be essential for storing useful information at a low cost to memory.</span>
        
        <span class = "nl">Let's look at an example of a structure.</span></p>
    
<em>Code:</em>
<!-- code -->
<pre class="code">
struct Time
{ 
    private int hours, minutes, seconds;
    
    public Time(int hh, int mm, int ss)
    {
        this.hours = hh % 24;
        this.minutes = mm % 60;
        this.seconds = ss % 60;
    }
    
    public int Hours()
    {
        return this.hours;
    }
}</pre>

<p>Other differences between classes and structures.  In a structure methods must contain parameters and any data types defined must be initialized.
    
    <span class = "nl">Initializing a structure.</span></p>
    
<em>Code:</em>
<!-- code -->
<pre class="code">
Time now = new Time();</pre>
