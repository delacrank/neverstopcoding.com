<h1>Objects and Classes - Learning C#</h1>
    

<!-- Classes -->
<h2>Objects and Classes</h2>

    <p> So, what are classes and how do we use them?  The first thing you should know about classes is that they are used to create objects.  What exactly is an object, its an instance of a class.  How do we instantiate classes and why do we need to?
        
        <span class = "nl">The answer to the first question is that a class is an abstract blue print for creating something.  The answer to the second question, is that an object is what the class created using those blue prints. The answer to the last question, is that in order to create an instance of a class we must allocate memory and place that memory in a location called the heap.</span>
        
        <span class = "nl">This leads me to another question, what is the heap?</span>
        
        <span class = "nl">The heap is a quick memory access location that the program can use in order to effectively carry out instructions.</span>
        
    <span class = "nl">Let's see an example of how we can create  objects in order to have them perform tasks.</span>
</p>
    
<em>Code:</em>
<!-- code -->
<pre class="code">
using System; 

<span class="highlight2">namespace</span> Addition
{ 
    public <span class="highlight3">class</span> Addition 
    { 
        public int <span class="highlight4">Add</span>(<span class="highlight">int a, int b</span>) 
        { 
            return a + b;
        } 

        static void Main(string[] args) 
        {     
            Addition <span class="highlight3">Z</span> = new Addition(); 
            Console.WriteLine("Add two numbers together"); 
            Console.WriteLine("Write the first number");
            int i = Convert.ToInt32(Console.ReadLine());     
            Console.WriteLine("Write the second number"); 
            int x = Convert.ToInt32(Console.ReadLine());
            Console.WriteLine(<span class="highlight3">Z</span>.<span class="highlight4">Add</span>(<span class="highlight">i , x</span>));     
            Console.WriteLine("Press any key to end the program"); 
            Console.ReadKey();  
        }
    } 
}</pre>
    
<p>By using the 'new' function we were able to create an instance of our addition class.  Then we used that accessed that instance by assigning it a variable called <span class="highlight3">Z</span>, which represents out 'Addition' class.. <br /><br /> Now we can use the 'Add' function in our 'Addition' class to add two numbers together: <span class="highlight3">Z</span>.<span class="highlight4">Add</span>(<span class="highlight">i , x</span>);.</p>

<!-- Defining Class Scope -->
<h3>Defining Class Scope</h3>
    
    <p>  In this section we will be talking about the scope of a class and what it will be able to encompass.  Let's take a look at some of the problems with creating methods within classes and the scope of the variables.
        
    <span class = "nl">Below is an example of two methods within the same class trying to share a variable which is declared in one method but not the other.</span></p>
    
<em>Code:</em>
<!-- code -->
<pre class="code"> 
class Example 
{ 
    void firstMethod()
    { 
        int myVar;  
    }
    
    void secondMethod()
    { 
        myVar = 42; 
    }
}</pre>

<p>Alright, so the problem with this example, is that we declared 'myVar' int variable within the curly braces of the first method, but then we gave the compiler no means of finding it again in the second method, this will draw an error.
    
    <span class = "nl">In order to solve this problem, we need to declare the variable outside the methods first so that they can all access them.</span></p>
    
<em>Code:</em>
<!-- code -->
<pre class="code">
class Example 
{ 
    void firstMethod()
    { 
        int myVar = 42;  
    }
    
    void secondMethod()
    { 
        myVar++; 
    }
    
    int myVar = 0;
}</pre>

<!-- Controlling Accessibility -->
<h3 >Controlling Accessibility</h3>
    
    <p> Let's say you want to create a variable for a class which won't be shared with other classes or methods outside the class itself.
        
<span class = "nl">We have to use something called a access modifier to protect the security of this variable and ensure that other classes cannot change its value.</span></p>
    
<em>Code:</em>
<!-- code -->
<pre class="code">
class Circle 
{ 
    private int radius;
    
    public double Area()
    { 
        return Math.PI * radius * radius; 
    } 
}</pre>
    
    <p>Notice how above, we have created a private integer variable which can be used inside our 'area' method.  This is due to both the variable and method being contained in the same scope, the 'Circle' class. 
        
    <span class = "nl">However, if I add another class called square and try to access the variable radius, I won't be able to.  Yet, I can still access the method area which contains the variable radius. </span>
       
    <span class = "nl">In a sense I can use the variable 'radius' as long as I do not make any changes to it.</span></p>
