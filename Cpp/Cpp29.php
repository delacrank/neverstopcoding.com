        <h1>Constructors - Cpp Development</h1>
        
        <h2>Constructors</h2>
        
            <p>First, let's understand why we need constructors and what they do for our classes or structures.  Remeber when we first started with journey with C++ and we learned the difference between declaration and definition.  
        
        <span class = "nl">Declaration is when we declare a variable but definition is when we initialize that variable to hold some sort of value.  Most variables are default initialized to zero/null/empty, like when we create an array or create parameters (temporary objects) in a function.</span>
        
        <span class = "nl">Then we learned about functions and pass by value.  When we used pass by value what we were doing was taking a copy of the function's value and storing in the object of our main function.  We could move copies of values between different scopes in order to solve problems in our program. </span>
                
        <span class="nl">Now imagine we have the same problem with our data structure.  We have a bunch of member objects which even if we initialized in the scope of our structure or class, wouldn't be copied into our main scope.  We need some way to initialize these objects in our main scope without worrying about changing the values of the scope in our structure or class.</span>
                
        <span class="nl">Let's look at an example of what that could look like.</span>
              </p>
        
    <em>Code:</em>
    <!-- code -->
    <pre class="code">
    #include &lt;string>
    #include &lt;iostream>

    struct Person {
    std::string name;
    std::string address;
        
    <span class="comments">// This is our constructor</span>
    Person(std::string n, std::string a) {
        name = n;
        address = a;
    }
        
        std::string printName() const { return name; }
        std::string printAddress() const { return address; }
    };

    int main()
    {
        <span class="comments">// We can initialize the objects of our choice now</span>
        Person jonh("Carlos", "New York 55");
       
        std::cout &lt;&lt; john.printName() &lt;&lt; std::endl;
        std::cout &lt;&lt; john.printAddress() &lt;&lt; std::endl;
        
        return 0;
    }</pre>
        
        <p>There is an alternative way to define a constructor as well.  I will show you the syntax for both below. </p>    
        
    <em>Code:</em>
    <!-- code -->
    <pre class="code">
    <span class="comments">// The way we first declared our constructor</span>
    Person(std::string n, std::string a) {
        name = n;
        address = a;
    }
    
    <span class="comments">// The alternate way member initialization</span>
    Person(std::string n, std::string a) :  name(n), address(a) {  }
    </pre>
        
        <p>Notice, that if we decide to use a constructor to initialize our struct or class then we must overload the constructor to handle calls for no parameters as well. This is called default initialization the syntax for it is shown below.</p>
        
    <em>Code:</em>
    <!-- code -->
    <pre class="code">
    Person() = default;</pre>
        
        <p>Now we can call our class or structure without having to initialize any members. To avoid using constructors all together I would suggest using list initialization, in order to initialize your member functions. </p>
        
    <em>Code:</em>
    <!-- code -->
    <pre class="code">
    #include &lt;string>
    #include &lt;iostream>

    struct Person {
        std::string name;
        std::string address;
    };
    
    int main()
    {
        <span class="comments">// List initialization</span>
        Person a {"Carlos", "55 New York"};
    }</pre>
        
        <p>If you are still having trouble with constructors below is a great video I found which explains more on the subject.</p>
