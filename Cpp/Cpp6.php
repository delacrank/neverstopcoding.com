        <h1>Working with Types - Cpp Development</h1>
        
        <h2>Working with Types</h2>
                
            <p>When dealing with data  there are various forms or 'types' of data.  Such as ints, doubles, floats, strings, enums, etc. they're are different classifications for what each data type can hold and how much data each type can hold.
        
        <span class = "nl">Previously, we spoke about using compound types such as references and pointers which hold multiple values (address, and values). The way we define a data type is by using it's keyword, this is called an explicit declaration, when we define the type of variable we are using.  In this section we are going to be talking about type aliases and implicit declarations.</span>
              </p>
        
        <hr />
        
        <!-- type aliases -->
        <h3>Type Aliases</h3>
        
            <p>The first type alias we can talk about is called <b>typedef</b> it defines the alias for the type like so.</p>
        
    <em>Code:</em>
    <!-- code -->
    <pre class="code">
    int main()
    {
        <span class="comments">// We want number to represent the integer type</span>
        typedef int number;
        
        <span class="comments">// Now I can use number to define var instead of int</span>
        number var = 3;
        
        cout &lt;&lt; var &lt;&lt; endl;
        
        return 0;
    }</pre>    
        
        <p>There is another way to use an alias in C++11 we assign the type with keyword <b>using</b>. Let's see the same example with this other method.  
            
        <span class="nl"><span class="red">Very Important!</span> -std=c++11 needs to be added to the command line as an arguement if you want any c++11 code to compile properly.</span></p>
        
        <em>Code:</em>
    <!-- code -->
    <pre class="code">
    int main()
    {
        <span class="comments">// We want number to represent the integer type</span>
        using number = int;
        
        <span class="comments">// Now I can use number to define var instead of int</span>
        number var = 3;
        
        cout &lt;&lt; var &lt;&lt; endl;
        
        return 0;
    }</pre>    
        
        <hr />
        
        <!-- Auto specifier -->
        <h3>Auto Specifier (Implicit Declaration)</h3>
        
            <p>I am not sure if you guys are familiar with C# (c sharp), if you are then you would be familiar with this keyword called 'var'.  It implicity defines the variable based on its initializer or based on the context of the expression.
        
        <span class ="nl">If I were to use the <b>auto</b> keyword with a number that had decimal points then the compiler could deduce that the variable must either be a float or a double, not an integer because integers don't contain decimal points.  The same would hold true if I declared a variable with a string, let's look at an example below.</span></p>
        
    <em>Code:</em>
    <!-- code -->
    <pre class="code">
    int main()
    {
        <span class="comments">// Use auto to implicity define my integer variable</span>
        auto var1 = 3;
        
        <span class="comments">// Use auto to implicity define my string variable</span>
        auto var2 = "hello";
        
        
        cout &lt;&lt; var1 &lt;&lt; " " &lt;&lt; var2 &lt;&lt; endl;
        
        return 0;
    } </pre>    
        
        
        <hr />
        
        <!-- decltype-->
        <h3>Decltype Specifier</h3>    
    
            <p>The <b>decltype</b> specifier is also native to C++11, it differs from 'auto' in the fact that it can declare a variable without having to initialize it, yet still use the compiler to imply the type of object we want based on the context of how it will be used.
                
        <span class = "nl">Obviously we can't use decltype in the same manner as auto, there are various types which cannot be declared unless initialized like: const variables or reference variables.  The way around this is by using const or reference variables which have already been initialized.</span></p>
        
        <hr />
        
        <!-- defining are own type -->
        <h3>Defining our own data type</h3>
        
            <p>Believe it or not we can define our own data type using something called a structure.  A structure is a group of related data elements.  Integer is a structure in c++ and String is class the difference between a structure and a class is how values are passed.  In a class values are passed by reference and in a structure values are passed by value.</p>
        
        <em>Code:</em>
    <!-- code -->
    <pre class="code">
    struct My_Data_set {
        int data1;
        int data2 = 0;
        int data3 = 0;
    };

    int main()
    {
        My_Data_set d;
     
        d.data1 = 2;
     
        cout &lt;&lt; d.data1 &lt;&lt; endl;
        
        return 0;
    }</pre>   
        
        <p>In the example above we created a object called d from our structure and using are object we could access members from our structure using the dot operator.  We accessed the data member from our structure initiailizied it to the number 2 and displayed it to the console using out output stream.</p>
