        <h1>Arrays - Cpp Development</h1>
        
        <h2>Working with Arrays</h3>
        
            <p>Arrays are different then vectors in the sense that they have a fixed sized which must be initialized before runtime.  However, it is due to this nature of having a fixed sized that they are faster to work with during runtime.</p>

        <h3>Initializing Arrays</h3>
        
            <p>Let's look at several ways to define and initialize an array of elements.</p>
        
        
    <em>Code:</em>
    <!-- code -->
    <pre class="code">
    int main()
    {
        int i = 5;
        <span class="comments">// We can initialize this array to having 5 elements</span>
        int arr[i];
        
        <span class="comments">// How about 20 pointers to an integer?</span>
        int *ptrarr[20];
        
        <span class="comments">// Or 10 strings?</span>
        string strarr[10];
    }</pre>
        
            <p>We can explicity intialize elements in our array using a list, like we did with our vectors.  Arrays use the subscript operator to determine the number of elements. However if we don't use a variable or function to determine the amount of elements in our array, it can initialized based using list initiailization.</p>
        
    <em>Code:</em>
    <!-- code -->
    <pre class="code">
    int main()
    {
        int arr[] = {1, 2, 3};
        
        cout &lt;&lt; arr[0] &lt;&lt; endl;
    }</pre>
        
        <hr />
        
        <!-- char arrays -->
        <h3>Char Arrays</h3>
        
        <p>Charater arrays are special in cpp.  They can be initialized in one of two ways, using a string literal or initializing each character individually. However all strings in cpp must end with a null character.  A null character looks like this '\0'. </p>
        
    <em>Code:</em>
    <!-- code -->
    <pre class="code">
    int main()
    {
        char a1[] = {'h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o', '\0'};
        
        for(auto s : a1)
            cout &lt;&lt; s;
            
        cout &lt;&lt; endl;
    }</pre>
        
         <p>If we try to use a string literal to initialize a character array without providing enough space for a null character then we will generate a compile time error.</p>
        
    <em>Code:</em>
    <!-- code -->
    <pre class="code">
    int main()
    {
        <span class="comments">// Error</span>
        char a1[5] = "hello";
    }</pre>
        
        <p>Arrays cannot be copied into each other, or assigned to one another.  You can't have a reference type array but, you can assign an array to hold references.</p>
        
    <em>Code:</em>
    <!-- code -->
    <pre class="code">
    int &amp;ref [10]; <span class="comments">// Error</span>
    int (&amp;ref) [10] = ref;<span class="comments">// refer to ten integers</span>
    </pre> 
        
        <hr />
        
        <!-- pointers & arrays -->
        <h3>Pointers &amp; Arrays</h3>
        
            <p>Pointers and arrays go hand in hand for displaying or manipulating elements in an array.  In order to assign a pointer to array just create the array and then use the address-of operator to point to an element in the array.</p>
        
    <em>Code:</em>
    <!-- code -->
    <pre class="code">
    int main()
    {
        string words[] = {"one", "two", "three"};
        string *p = &amp;words[0];
        
        cout &lt;&lt; *p &lt;&lt; endl;
    }</pre>
        
        <hr />
        
        <!-- Pointers are iterators -->
        <h3>Pointers are iterators</h3>
        
            <p>Previously we learned that we can use pointers in order to access elements inside an array.  Yet, it would be cumbersome to create a pointer for every single element in our array.  This brings me to our next lesson, pointers are iterators and similar to iterators the value in a pointer can be changed to reflect the location in an array. 
        
        <span class = "nl">We can even set a pointer equal to the element after the last one in our array, to use as a means of an end memeber.</span>
              </p>
        
    <em>Code:</em>
    <!-- code -->
    <pre class="code">
    int main()
    {
        int ia[] = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9};
        int *e = &amp;ia[10];
        
        for(int *b = ia; b != e; ++b)
            cout &lt;&lt; *b &lt;&lt; endl;
    }</pre>
        
        <p>By incrementing the pointer by one for every interval in our loop, we are moving in from the first element '[0]' to the last one '[9]', then our loop ends are the element after the last one '[10]'.</p>
