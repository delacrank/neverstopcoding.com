        <h1>Const Qualifer - Cpp Programming</h1>
        
        <h2>Const Qualifer</h2>
        
            <p>This section is dedicated to a variable modifer called const, short for constant because once the variable is initialized it must remain constant.  The variable can no longer be incremented, decremented or reassigned to a new value.</p>
        
        <hr />
        
        <!-- initialize and const -->
        <h3>Initialization of Const variables</h3>
        
            <p>Let's look at an example of creating an unchanging variable.We can accomplish this by initializing the variable at either compile time or run time.</p>
        
    <em>Code:</em>
    <!-- code -->
    <pre class = "code">
    #include &lt;iostream>
    
    int main() {
        const int i = 42;
    }  </pre>
        
        <hr />
        
        <!-- const vars are local -->
        <h3>Using extern Qualifer</h3>
        
            <p>In order for const variable to be shared among multiple files (a global variable for example) we need to re-initialize our const variable in every file.  This can be tedious and annoying and even lead to mistakes, it is also unsafe to re-initialize a variable in multiple files (in case you initialize the variable to multiple values).
        
        <span class = "nl">So for this purpose we can use a different qualifer called extern.  If we initialize our const variable in one file, our program will know to use that same value in another file or header with the extern qualifer.</span>
              </p>
            
    <em>Code:</em>
    <!-- code -->
    <pre class = "code">
    <span class="comments">// file main.cpp</span>
    #include &lt;iostream>
    #include "main1.cpp"
    
    extern const int i;
    
    int main() {
        std:: cout &lt;&lt; i &lt;&lt; std::endl;
    }  </pre>
    <br />
        
    <em>Code:</em>
    <!-- code -->
    <pre class = "code">
     <span class="comments">// file main1.cpp</span>
    extern const int i = 42;</pre>
        
        <hr />
        
        <!-- Reference to const -->
        <h3>References to const</h3>
        
            <p>Previously we talked about using the const qualifer to refer to initialized variables which will retain their value for the length of the program.  Now I want to refer to another type of const qualifer which refers to variables which are already const.
        
        <span class = "nl">This means if we declare and initialize a const variable 'pi' to 3.14, we can no longer bind it to a non const reference variable. <u>We now require the use of a const reference variable in order bind const variable type.</u></span>
                
        <span class="nl">Let's try to run the code below and see what happens when we compile it.</span>
              </p>
        
    <em>Code:</em>
    <!-- code -->
    <pre class="code">
    <span class="comments">// Error, initializing a const to a non-const reference variable</span>
    int main ()
    {
        const int pi = 3.14;
        int &amp;p = pi;
        
        return 0;
    }</pre>
        
        <p>This isn't to say that we cannot bind a non const int to a const ref, let's look at an example of this below.</p>
        
    <em>Code:</em>
    <!-- code -->
    <pre class="code">
    <span class="comments">// However, a const reference variable can be binded to a non-const variable</span>
    int main ()
    {
        int pi = 3.14;
        const int &amp;p = pi;
        
        return 0;
    }</pre>
        
        <p>Just becareful when using const references because we cannot initialize a non const ref to a const ref in the next example below.</p>
        
        
    <em>Code:</em>
    <!-- code -->
    <pre class="code">
    <span class="comments">// Error, initializing a non-const reference variable to a const reference variable</span>
    int main ()
    {
        int pi = 3.14;
        const int &amp;p = pi;
        int &amp;r = p;
        
        return 0;
    }</pre>
        
        <hr />
        
    <!-- Pointers and Const -->
    <h3>Pointers and const</h3>
        
        <p>Similar to our const references, pointers can only refer to non const pointers.  If we have a const data type then we need a const pointer if we want to initialize that variable to a pointer.
        
        <span class = "nl">Let's look at an example below.</span>
              </p>
        
     <em>Code:</em>
    <!-- code -->
    <pre class="code">
    <span class="comments">// The pointer needs to be a const to point to another const variable </span>
    int main ()
    {
        const int pi = 3.14;
        const int *cp = &amp;pi;
        
        return 0;
    }</pre>
        
        <p>If we use a const pointer, we cannot re-assign the value to something else.</p>
