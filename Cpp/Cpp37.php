        <h1>Polymorphism - Cpp Development</h1>
        
        <h2>Polymorphism</h2>
        
        <p>Polymorphism has to do with allowing functions from derived classes to override the function from our base class.  The overall concept is that derived classes can change shape and take a form on their own.
        
        <span class = "nl">Let's look at an example of this, if we create three classes and provide them all with the same function.  What is to say that calling a derived function will execute over our base function.</span>
            
        <span class = "nl">Here is an example of some code.</span></p>
        
    <em>Code:</em>
    <!-- code -->
    <pre class="code">
    #include &lt;iostream>
    
    using namespace std;
    
    <span class = "comments">// Create our Base Class</span>
    class Base {
    public:
        void BaseFunc()
        {
            cout &lt;&lt; "Base function" &lt;&lt; endl;
        }
    };
    
    <span class = "comments">// Create our Derived Class</span>
    class Derived : public Base {
    public:
        void BaseFunc()
        {
            cout &lt;&lt; "Derived function" &lt;&lt; endl;
        }
    
    };
    
    <span class = "comments">// Create our second Derived Class</span>
    class Derived2 : public Base {
    public:
        void BaseFunc()
        {
            cout &lt;&lt; "Derived function2" &lt;&lt; endl;
        }
    };
    
    int main()
    {
        <span class ="comments">// Create a pointer to our base class</span>
        Base *b;
        <span class ="comments">// Let's creates objects for our dervied classes</span>
        Derived d;
        Derived2 d2;
        <span class = "comments">// Call the base function</span>
        b->BaseFunc();
        <span class = "comments">// Assign our pointer to one of our derived functions</span>
        b = &amp;d;
        <span class = "comments">// Call our derived function</span>
        b->BaseFunc();
        b = &amp;d2;
        b->BaseFunc();
    }</pre>
        
        <p>Now, if you will notice each time we called our base function, only our base function was invoked.  None of our derived functions were called?  Why is this, maybe its because our compiler doesn't know where to go in order to call our derived functions.
        
        <span class = "nl">However, by adding the keyword 'virtual' to the front of our functions, can let our compiler know where to go in order to invoke the proper function.  Let's look at the same code, however this time we'll add the virtual keyword.</span></p>
        
    <em>Code:</em>
    <!-- code -->
    <pre class="code">
    #include &lt;iostream>
    
    using namespace std;
    
    class Base {
    public:
        void virtual BaseFunc()
        {
            cout &lt;&lt; "Base function" &lt;&lt; endl;
        }
    };
    
    class Derived : public Base {
    public:
        void BaseFunc()
        {
            cout &lt;&lt; "Derived function" &lt;&lt; endl;
        }
    
    };
    
    <span class = "comments">// Create our second Derived Class</span>
    class Derived2 : public Base {
    public:
        void BaseFunc()
        {
            cout &lt;&lt; "Derived function2" &lt;&lt; endl;
        }
    };
    
    int main()
    {
        Base *b;
        Derived d;
        Derived2 d2;
        <span class = "comments">// Don't call the base function, it is virtual. Will crash program.</span>
        // b->BaseFunc();
        b = &amp;d;
        b->BaseFunc();
        b = &amp;d2;
        b->BaseFunc();
    }</pre>
        
        <p>Notice how this time around our derived classes actually called their derived functions. Which is nice because we can a lot of different functionality to each of our derived classes.</p>
