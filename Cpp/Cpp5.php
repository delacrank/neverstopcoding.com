        <h1>Writing Header Files - Cpp Programming</h1>
        
        <h2>Writing Header Files</h2>
        
            <p>In other languages we have classes to contain information/data.  So in Java or C# every piece of source code will be a class.  These languages are considered OOL (object oriented languages), however with C++ it is considered a multi-paradigm language so it can be written as a procedural language or as an object oriented language (using classes).
        
        <span class = "nl">Yet, if we don't use classes how will we organize are code, where will we store our functions and global variables? This is where 'header files' come in.  They use the same compiler but they come in two forms, dot h for 'c header files' and dot hh for 'cpp header files'.</span>
                
        <span class="nl">In our 'Printing Output' section (Cpp1.html) we talked about preprocessors, specificly the '#include' preprocessor and how it was necessary to use input and output streams (functions stored in the iostream library).  </span>
                
        <span class="nl">We will use this same preprocessor directive to include our header files, only we will use quotion marks ( "header.h" ) instead of greater than or lessthan signs signs ( &lt;header.h> ). The difference between the two is that the quotation marked headers will only be searched for in the same directory as the file indicated, while the less than greater than signs have a predefined search sequence written into the compiler. </span>

        <!-- header guards -->
        <h3>Header Guards</h3>
    
            <p>A header guard checks to see if a header file has been defined already, if it has not then it defines the header and if it has been defined then it ignores the header file.  This is done to avoid errors when headers contain multiple defintiions.
        
        <span class = "nl">The first guard is called <b>'#ifndef HEADERFILE_H'</b> the 'headerfile' can be substituted for the real header name. This guard will check to see if the header file has been defined, if it hasn't then we will define it using our next guard. <b>'#define HEADERFILE_H' </b> this defines the header file for the first time, the program will now be able to use all the functions and variables in the file.</span>
                    
        <span class = "nl"><b>'#endif'</b> is the last guard and it's use with the first '#ifndef', this guard just ends the original if statement, so if the intial if was false and the file was ignored it would stop ignoring the header file after this guard.</span>
                
        <span class="nl">Let's look at an example of some code which uses a header file.</span>
              </p>
        
    <em>Code:</em>
    <!-- code -->
    <pre class="code">
    <span class="comments">// test.cpp</span>
    #include &lt;iostream>
    #include "header1.h"
    
    int main()
    {
        std::cout &lt;&lt; ok &lt;&lt; std::endl;
        
        return 0;
    }</pre>
    <br />    
        
    <em>Header:</em>
    <!-- code -->
    <pre class="code">
    <span class="comments">// header1.h</span>
    #ifndef HEADER1_H
    #define HEADER1_H
    
    std::string ok = "hello";
    
    #endif</pre>
        
    <p>Alright, if we included our header1.h file in the same directory as our test.cpp file then this program should compile just fine if I type in 'g++ test.cpp' and then run it typing in './a.out'.</p>
        
    <hr />
    
    <!-- preprocessor directives -->
    <h3>Preprocessor Directives</h3>
        
        <p>These header guards are actually called preprocessor directives and they can be used in a variety of ways.  They are commonly used in 'c' in order to define constant variables (variables whose values cannot be changed onced initialized).  However, in 'cpp' we have the 'const' keyword which does the same function, without getting overly complicated.
        
        <span class = "nl">In order to use these directives let's look at some sample code.</span></p>
        
        
    <em>Code:</em>
    <!-- code -->
    <pre class="code">
    #include &lt;iostream>
    
    using namespace std;
    
    int main()
    {
        <span class = "comments">// check if 'VARIABLE' is defined</span>
        #ifdef VARIABLE
                std::cout &lt;&lt; "This is defined" &lt;&lt; std::endl;
        <span class = "comments">// If its not defined do this instead</span>
        #else
                std::cout &lt;&lt; "This is not defined" &lt;&lt; std::endl;
        <span class = "comments">// End the if statement</span>
        #endif
                
        return 0;
    }</pre>    
        
        <p>So, our program should just print out the second statement. Why, because we haven't defined our 'VARIABLE' preprocessor. We can define it using the '#define' preprocessor (#define VARIABLE) or we can type in '-D VARIABLE' in our command line. 
        
        <span class = "nl">Let's try that and see the output.</span></p>
        
    <em>Code:</em>
    <!-- code -->
    <pre class="code">
    clang++ -std=c++11 test.cpp -o test <span class ="red">-D VARIABLE</span></pre>
