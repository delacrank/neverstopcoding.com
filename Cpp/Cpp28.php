        <h1>User Defined Types - Cpp Development</h1>
        
        <h2>User Defined Types</h2>
        
            <p>The first thing you should understand about data structures or classes is that they are a way for programmers to create abstract data types (objects).
                
        <span class="nl">Abstraction in programming refers to coming up with an idea which solves a problem, its the concept of 'thinking' about programming not through logical and mathetical decisions but, through concepts and designs. </span>
                
        <span class="nl">Rather than just thinking of a way to solve a problem a data structure/class would come up with several ways of approaching it by developing objects which don't already exist. An example of thise would be the string class.</span>
                
        <span class="nl">In 'c' the way words are written are through the use of character arrays which take values, convert them into characters and store them sequentialy in an array ending the array with a null character. What if we had a string class which could handle these sorts of arrays without having to do all the sticky coding (implementation).</span>
                
        <span class="nl">Everytime we want to store a series of characters in a way we just type 'std::string var' (interface) then we can store our string literals in that variable. Creating a class solves two things a way to implement (encapsulation) an idea and a way for someone else to use that implementation (interface).</span>
                
        <span class="nl">Let's look at an example of a data structure, though they are both the same in concept a structure stores memory on the stack while a class stores memory on the heap.</span>
              </p>
        
    <em>Code:</em>
    <!-- code -->
    <pre class="code">
    #include &lt;string>

    struct Person {
        std::string name;
        std::string address;
    };</pre>
        
        <p>In the example above we created a structure called person and declared two types of strings in our struct, a name and an address. Classes or structures are usually stored in a header file so we should use our header guards if we want to store it in a header.</p>
        
    <em>Code:</em>
    <!-- code -->
    <pre class="code"><span class="red">    #ifndef Person_h
    #define Person_h</span>
    
    #include &lt;string>

    struct Person {
        std::string name;
        std::string address;
    }<span class="red">;</span>
    
    <span class="red">#endif</span></pre>
        
        <p>Whether your dealing with a structure or class they should always end with a semicolon at the end of the closing bracket.  If we want to return values from our structure we should include functios which can call those values.</p>
        
    <em>Code:</em>
    <!-- code -->
    <pre class="code">
    #ifndef Person_h
    #define Person_h
    
    #include &lt;string>

    struct Person {
        std::string name;
        std::string address;
        
        std::string printName() const { return name; }
        std::string printAddress() const { return address; }
    };
    
    #endif</pre>
        
        <p>These two functions allow us to return the values of our name and address without modifying the originals.  Also the fact that they are both const strings means that we won't be able to change them, this is important for dealing with both classes and structures. It ensures that our class or struct variables remains intact reguardless of how many programmers use it. 
            
    <span class = "nl">Before we move on ensure that your header file's name matches the name of your header guards, otherwise the guards won't won't. Also, let's make sure that our header file is in the same folder as our 'main.cpp' file, otherwise we would have to specify the directory in our 'include' preprocessor directive.</span>
        
    <span class="nl">Let's look at how we would possibly call these structure from our header to our main function.</span></p>
        
    <em>Code:</em>
    <!-- code -->
    <pre class="code">
    #include &lt;iostream>
    <span class="comments">// Include the header for our struct</span>
    #include "Person.h"
    
    int main()
    {
        <span class="comments">// Declare our struct</span>
        Person john;
        
        <span class="comments">// Initialize the name variable in our structure to 'johnny'</span>
        john.name = "Johnny";
        
        <span class="comments">// Return the value of our name by calling the function 'printName'</span>
        std::cout &lt;&lt; john.printName() &lt;&lt; std::endl;
    }</pre>
        
        <p>Calling a structure is similar to the way we would call our variables. In the case of the variable john we must first declare the type of data object, in our case that type is an abstract one called 'Person'.  Everytime we use the john variable we are referring to the 'Person' object, our compiler knows where to refer to john due to this declaration.
        
        <span class = "nl">In order to access any of the functions or variables in our Person structure we must first let our compiler know where the objects are located, for this we use the 'dot' operator to access these functions and variables.</span>
            
        <span class="nl">When I initialized the name variable, I used my 'dot' operator to let the compiler know where this variable exists.  The same thing happened when I called the 'printName()' function.</span>
              </p>
