        <h2>Multidimensional Arrays</h2>
                
            <p>In this section we are going to talk about multidimensional arrays, and pointers.</p>

        <!-- Initializing a vector -->
        <h3>Initiailizing a vector using an array</h3>
        
            <p>Previously I showed you how to initialize a vector using an array.  This is just a few more examples of how to accomplish this task.</p>
        
    <em>Code:</em>
    <!-- code -->
    <pre class="code">
    int ia[] = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    
    vector&lt;int> ivec(begin(ia), end(ia));
    
    for (auto i : ivec)
        cout &lt;&lt; i &lt;&lt; endl;</pre>
        
        <p>We can take it one step further and create a range of elements from which to use by using pointer arithmetic.</p>
        
    <em>Code:</em>
    <!-- code -->
    <pre class="code">
    int ia[] = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    
    vector&lt;int> ivec2(ia + 1, ia + 4);
    
    for (auto i : ivec2)
        cout &lt;&lt; i &lt;&lt; endl;</pre>
        
            <p>Above we ensured that the range was kept within and including the second and forth elements.</p>

        <!-- 2 dimensional arrays -->
        <h3>Multidimensional Arrays</h3>
        
            <p>A multidimensional array in cpp is similar an array within an existing array.  An example of this would be a collection within a collection.
                
        <span class="nl">If I owned a crayon company and had an array of crayon boxes, then the crayons inside each box would be our second array within our first.  Each crayon would be specific to only one element in our collection one way to display this information would be similar to a tree.</span></p>
        
<pre>
                Box 1               Box 2               Box 3
               /  |  \             /  |  \             /  |  \
            red blue green    yellow  oj brown      teal red white</pre>
        
        <p>As you can see we have an array of 3 boxes and within our array we have another array of 3 crayons for each box. The array of boxes is considered our first dimension and the array of crayons is our second dimension.
        
        <span class="nl">To display this using code would look like this.</span></p>
        
    <em>Code:</em>
    <!-- code -->
    <pre class="code">
    int main() {
     string boxes[3][3] = {
        {"red", "green", "blue"},
        {"yellow", "oj", "brown"},
        {"teal", "red", "white"}        
    };
    
     for(auto i : boxes)
         cout &lt;&lt; *i &lt;&lt; " " &lt;&lt;  *(i + 1) &lt;&lt; " " &lt;&lt; *(i + 2) &lt;&lt; endl;
    }</pre>
            
        <p>With a multidimensional array the first subscript operator will determine the amount of elements within the array, while the second subscript operator will determine the amount of elements within each element for the first array.
        
        <span class = "nl">For example, if I have an multidimension array of 2 elements and 2 more elements within each of the first elements, I can determine the total by multiplying the two subscript operators together.  So four would be the total, that means a 2 nested elements within the first element for every element in my array.</span>
              </p>

        <!-- iterating through loops -->
        <h3>Using the for Range Loop</h3>
        
            <p>It can be complicated to iterate through every element in a multidimension array.  However, there are some functions which help us with this process, in particular the 'for range' loop is a quick and dirty means of calling every element in our array.
        
        <span class = "nl">Let's look at an example below.</span>
              </p>
        
    <em>Code:</em>
    <!-- code -->
    <pre class="code">
    int main() {
     string boxes[3][3] = {
        {"red", "green", "blue"},
        {"yellow", "oj", "brown"},
        {"teal", "red", "white"}        
    };
    
     for(auto &amp;i : boxes)
         for(auto j : i)
            cout &lt;&lt; j &lt;&lt; endl;
    }</pre>
        
        <p>In the previous example I used pointer arithmetic to access every element in the array.  In the example above, I can access each element using a nested for range loop. 
        
        <span class = "nl">Doing it this way is easier for changing or adding values to my array.</span></p>
        
        <hr />
        
        <!-- iterating regular loops -->
        <h3>Using a regular for Loop</h3>
        
            <p>We have the option of using just a regular for loop to iterator through our multidimensional array as well.  Let's take a look at what this looks like.</p>
        
        <em>Code:</em>
    <!-- code -->
    <pre class="code">
    int main() {
    string boxes[3][3] = {
        {"red", "green", "blue"},
        {"yellow", "oj", "brown"},
        {"teal", "red", "white"}        
    };
    
    for(auto i = 0; i &lt; 3; ++i)
        for(auto j = 0; j &lt; 3; ++j)
            cout &lt;&lt; boxes[i][j] &lt;&lt; endl;         
    }</pre>
        
            <p>In the example above we can loop through every array by substituting the variables 'i' and 'j' to call each element using our subscript operator.
        
        <span class="nl">In short the loop will first call 'boxes[0][0]' then 'boxes[0][1]' until it finally ends with 'boxes[3][3]'.</span>
              </p>
