        <h1>Vectors - Cpp Development</h1>
        
        <h2>Working with Vectors</h2>
        
            <p>In order to work with vectors we need first include the vector library '#include &lt;vector>' and if we want to declare or define any vectors we need to use 'std::vector' or we can just use the using directive 'using std::vector'.
        
        <span class = "nl">A vector is similar to other data structures like enumerations, arrays, in the sense that it holds data in a sequential order.  The difference is the types of objects which can be held in the various elements of a vector.</span>
              </p>

        <h3>Declaring &amp; Defining Vectors</h3>
        
            <p>There are multiple ways to initialize vectors.  We can use parenthese to define the amount of elements in an array and then initialize each element using the second argument.  This is called value initialization.
        
        <span class = "nl">The second way to initialize a vector is called list initialization, this is where we write out every element in the array, similar to the way we would initialize an array or enumeration.  There is another way to initialize a vector which happens during runtime, we will talk about that soon, for now let's look at an example of list initialization.</span>
              </p>
        
    <em>Code:</em>
    <!-- code -->
    <pre class="code">
    #include &lt;iostream>
    #include &lt;vector>
    #include &lt;string>
    
    int main()
    {
        <span class="comments">// Let's declare a vector of strings</span>
        std::vector&lt;std::string> svec;
        
        <span class="comments">// If we want to declare of vector of int</span>
        std::vector&lt;int> ivec;
        
        <span class="comments">// We can initialize our string vector using list initialization</span>
        svec = {"first", "second", "third"};
        
        <span class="comments">// Now let's initialize our int vector using list initialization</span>
        ivec = {1, 2, 3};
        
        <span class="comments">// To see the elements in my vector, use subscript operator</span>
        std::cout &lt;&lt; "first string element: " &lt;&lt; svec[0] &lt;&lt; std::endl;
        std::cout &lt;&lt; "first int element: " &lt;&lt; ivec[0] &lt;&lt; std::endl;
        
        return 0;
    }</pre>
        
        <p>Now let's look at an example of value initialization, if we just declare the number of elements in the vector without giving them a value, then they will be initialized to either 0, or null (empty) string by default.</p>
        
    <em>Code:</em>
    <!-- code -->
    <pre class="code">
    int main()
    {
        <span class="comments">// Value initialization of a string, 10 elements containing the value "hi"</span>
        std::vector&lt;std::string> svec (10, "hi");
        
        <span class="comments">// Value initialization of an int, ten elements containing the value of 1</span>
        std::vector&lt;int> ivec (10, 1);
        
        <span class="comments">// We can use iteration to loop through our elements</span>
        for(int i = 0; i &lt; 10; ++i)
            std::cout &lt;&lt; "Our string element" &lt;&lt; i &lt;&lt; ": " &lt;&lt; svec[i] &lt;&lt; std::endl;
            
        return 0;     
    }</pre>

        <h3>Adding elements during runtime</h3>
        
            <p>One of the beauties of using vectors instead of arrays is the ability to add elements during runtime as appose to initializing them using a list before we compile.
        
        <span class="nl">If we want to add elements during runtime we need to use a function called <b>push_back()</b>. Using this functions allows us to initialize a very large vector let's say if we want to add 200 elements and initialize every single element to a number from 1 to 200, it would be extremely tedious to have to write this list.</span>
            
        <span class="nl">However, if we could initialize our list during runtime then we could write a loop which could initialize every element in our vector. Let's look at an example of this.</span></p>
                
    <em>Code:</em>
    <!-- code -->
    <pre class="code">
    using namespace std;
    
    int main()
    {
        vector&lt;int> v1;
        
        <span class="comments">// Add 100 elements to my array increment each by one</span>
        for(int i = 0; i != 100; ++i)
            v1.push_back(i);
            
        <span class="comments">// Let's call the first 10 elements</span>
        for (int i = 0; i &lt; 10; ++i)
            cout &lt;&lt; v1[i] &lt;&lt; endl;
        
        return 0;    
    } </pre>
        
        <p>Now, let's use this same approach only this time instead of using a loop to automatically initialize each element, let's initialize each element our selves using the console.</p>
        
    <em>Code:</em>
    <!-- code -->
    <pre class="code">
    using namespace std;
    
    int main()
    {
        <span class="comments">// Let's declare a variable to store our elements</span>
        string word;
        
        <span class="comments">// Declare our vector</span>
        vector&lt;string> v1;
        
        <span class="comments">// We can initialize as many elements as we want, use EOF to end</span>
        while(cin >> word) {
            v1.push_back(word);
        }
        
        <span class="comments">// Print the first ten</span>
        for (int i = 0; i &lt; v1.size(); ++i)
            cout &lt;&lt; v1[i] &lt;&lt; endl;
        
        return 0;
    } </pre>
        
        <p>Great, now our program will run its course until we hit EOF or 'control - D' and then it will print out every word we stored in our vector.</p>
