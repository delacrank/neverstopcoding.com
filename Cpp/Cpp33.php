        <h1>Class Scope - Cpp Development</h1>
        
        <h2>Understanding Class Scope</h2>
        
            <p>Understanding scope is something which is very important in programming.  In other sections I showed you how to define a global variable verses a local variable.  Also, I have showed you how to access variables and functions outside our source file using the scope operator '::', like when using functions from the standard library such as 'std::cout' or accessing a container like 'std::string'.
        
        <span class = "nl">There are also scopes within a function called a private variables, the variables within our functions (outside our main function) can be used only within the opening and closing brackets '{' and '}'. One of the ways to access these sorts of variables is by using a pointer '*' or a reference operator '&amp;' in order to access the address of these private variables, and then call or modify their values in our main function.</span>
        
        <span class = "nl">Then we have scope within are classes public and private member variables. Public member variables can be used if we create an object and use the dot access operator '.' (classObject.memberVariable). Private variables can be accessed using a function call in order to 'return' the variable into a public scope. The last way to access private or public variables from a class is uing the 'friend' qualifer for our functions.</span>
        
        <span class = "nl">In this section we are going to go over how to understand the differences in scope within our class, in perticular when accessing parameters and variables within our member functions.</span>
        
        <span class = "nl">Let's take a look at an example below.</span></p>
        
    <em>Code:</em>
    <!-- code -->
    <pre class="code">
    <span class = "comments">// define global int var</span>
    int var = 5;
    
    class Person {
    public:
        <span class = "comments">// which var is returned global or private?</span>
        int getVar() { return var; }
    
    private:
        <span class = "comments">// define private member int var</span>
        int var = 10;
    };
    
    int main()
    {
        Person p;
        
        <span class = "comments">// number 5 for global var, number 10 for private var</span>
        std::cout &lt;&lt; p.getVar() &lt;&lt; "\n";
    }</pre>
        
        <p>If you did the exercise you would see the private variable was returned.  If we changed the code to use the scope operator we could assign the global variable to our return function like so.</p>
        
    <em>Code:</em>
    <!-- code -->
    <pre class="code">
    <span class = "comments">// This should return the number 5, our global value</span>
    int getVar() { return <span class = "red">::</span>var; }</pre>
        
        <p>In these next examples I will be using the 'this' keyword, the 'this' is pointer which refers to the invoking object.</p>
        
     <em>Code:</em>
    <!-- code -->
    <pre class="code">
    <span class = "comments">// Ensure that we are using a member variable</span>
    int getVar() { return <span class = "red">Person::</span>var; }
    
    <span class = "comments">// Or we could do it this way instead</span>
    int getVar() { return <span class = "red">this-></span>var; }
    </pre>
    <hr />    
        
        <!-- Constructor Lists -->    
        <h3>Constructor List</h3>
        
            <p>A constructor list is a way we are able to initialize variables for our classes.  Similar to the way we have initialized our variables inside the class using constructor when declaring member functions, we can also declare the constructor outside of our header or class file.</p>
        
    <em>Code:</em>
    <!-- code -->
    <pre class = "code">
    class Person
    {
    public:
        <span class="comments">// Declare your constructor first</span>
        Person();
        
    private:
        int var;
        int var2;
    };
    
    <span class="comments">// Constructor Initializer List</span>
    Person::Person()
    {
        var = 5;
        var2 = 10;
    }</pre>
        
        <p>Be sure that when using a constructor initializer that you declare the constructor function in your class.  Let's look at an example if you wanted to initialize your own private variables.</p>
        
        <em>Code:</em>
    <!-- code -->
    <pre class = "code">
    class Person
    {
    public:
        <span class="comments">// Declare your constructor parameters</span>
        Person(int, int);
        
    private:
        int var;
        int var2;
    };
    
    Person::Person(int x, int y)
    {
    <span class="comments">// Initialize your private member variables to your parameters</span>
        var = x;
        var2 = y;
    }
    
    int main()
    {
        Person p(5, 10);
    }</pre>
    <hr />
        
        <!-- delegating Constructors -->
        <h3>Delegating Constructors</h3>
        
            <p>There is another option to initializing private member variables in a class.  The first option is using a default constructor to initialize all the member variables to either null or zero, the second option is initializing them in our main function via the constructor, the third option is using a constructor initializer.
        
        <span class = "nl">However, the new standard c++11 allows us to use a delegate to initialize the private member variables while declaring the constructor itself.  Let's take a look at this.</span></p>
        
    <em>Code:</em>
    <!-- code -->
    <pre class="code">
    class Person {
    public:
        Person(int x, int y) : var(x), var2(y) { }
        <span class="comments">// Our Constructor delegate</span>
        Person () : Person (5, 10) { }
    private:
        int var;
        int var2;
    }</pre>
