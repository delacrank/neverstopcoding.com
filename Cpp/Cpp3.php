        <h1>Compound Variables - Cpp Development</h1>
        
        <h2>Compound Variables</h2>
        
            <p>In this section I'm going to explain the differents between value types and reference types.  Some of the variables we will be dealing with have multiple meanings and contain more than one element depending on the operator used.</p>
        
        <hr />
        
        <!-- references -->
        <h3>References</h3>
        
            <p>The first type of compound variable I will be talking about are called references.  The only thing a reference does it reveal the address of variable's location stored in memory.  To see an example of this, I will define variable 'x', intialize it and then and bind it the reference 'x1'.  A reference <u>must</u> be intialized.</p>
        
    <em>Code:</em>
    <!-- code -->
    <pre class = "code">
    #include &lt;iostream>
        
    int main () {
        int x =  0;
        int &amp;xl = x;
        std::cout &lt;&lt; "Reveal the address of xl: " &lt;&lt; &amp;xl &lt;&lt; std::endl;
        std::cout &lt;&lt; "Reveal the value of xl: " &lt;&lt; xl &lt;&lt; std::endl;
    } </pre>
        
        <p>Alright, so now you can see some of reasons why a reference is considered a compound variable.  It can hold multiple values, one value refers to its address and the other refers to its intiailized value.
        
        <span class = "nl">If for example you defined a reference as a integer type, then you cannot assign it to a double value or double data type.  Also, once you change the value of a reference or the intial variable then both values are changed.  Think of a reference as an alias, one refers to the other and vice versa they are bound to the same address, so logically they cannot hold two seperate values.</span>
              </p>
        
    <hr />    
        
        <!-- pointers -->
        <h3>Pointers</h3>
        
            <p>I know this topic is going to confuse a lot of people, so I will start out by adding a video which I found to be amusing and instructive.</p>
        
        <div class = "video"><iframe style = "margin-left: 1em" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Rxvv9krECNw"></iframe></div>
    
            <p>Alright, if you watched the video or if you are already familiar with pointers then, the next thing I will dive into is explaining why we need pointers if we have references.  
        
        <span class = "nl">A pointer is a compound variable which indirectly addresses another variable.  The way it does this is by telling the compiler where the variable is located, so it points to the location of the variable.  However, unlike a reference a pointer isn't bound to any one variable.  </span>
                
        <span class="nl">In fact, one of thing that sets pointers and references apart is that a pointer can be reassigned to pointer to another variable.  In this way, we can reuse pointers over and over while references remain bound to their initial variables.</span>
                
        <span class="nl">Let's look at some code.</span>
              </p>
        
    <em>Code:</em>
    <!-- code -->
    <pre class="code">
    #include &lt;iostream>
        
    int main () {
        int x;
        int *p = &amp;x;
        std::cout &lt;&lt; &amp;x &lt;&lt; std::endl;
    } </pre>

    
        <p>But wait, didn't I just say that its not possible to use a reference without intializing the variable first?!  One thing to note, is that similar to how our compound variables can represent two values, our operators can perform multiple operations. 
        
        <span class = "nl">In the example above I am not using a reference, instead I'm using an address of operator '&amp;'.  When you assign a pointer to a variable's address you use the address of operator which is different.</span>
            
        <span class="nl">So how do I return the value of 'x'? In order to display the value of 'x' what we need to do is dereference our pointer to instead display the value of are variable instead of it's address.  Currently, are pointer has two values assigned to it: the location of x, and the value of x.</span>
            
        <span class="nl">Let's look at another example.</span>
              </p>
        
    <em>Code:</em>
    <!-- code -->
    <pre class="code">
    #include &lt;iostream>
        
    int main () {
        int x = 3;
        int *p = &amp;x;
        std::cout &lt;&lt; "Print the value of x: " &lt;&lt; *p &lt;&lt;
        "\nPrint the address of x: " &lt;&lt; p &lt;&lt; std::endl;
    } </pre>    
        
        <p>I initialized 'x' to equal three, although I could have left it unitialized and the program would have still worked.  Dereferencing our pointer is similar to saying we just want to look at the value of x, the pointer acts as a middle man.  Learning about pointers may seem pointless now, you will understand later how this becomes very convienent for working with variables outside of our scope.</p>
