<h2>Understanding our database</h2>
    
    <p>Alright so first let's start with our database. First I want to establish that there are different syntaxes for different databases. The syntax for working with Ms SQL is called Transact Sequel and is more of an extension to SQL, in that is has some scripting capabilities.
    
    <span class = "nl">Let's look at the script first and then I can start to break down the code.</span></p>
    
    <em>Code:</em>

    <p>In order to understand the script, you should probably know SQL. This sql script does several things. First it drops any existing database named halloween if it exists, then it creates a new one.
    
    <span class = "nl">Some of the commands like 'set ansi_nulls on' or 'set quoted_identifier on' are explained by comments I added to the script. The first command simply implies that null values aren't going to be returned or used for in comparsion expressions.  The second statement allows string literals to be passed if they are quoted.</span>
        
    <span class = "nl">These commands are generated by the engine used to generate the script for creating the database.</span></p>
        
    <hr />
    
    <h3>Creating the Tables</h3>
        
    <p>Alright, let's create a table or several. First, we create a table called Categories with rows CategoryID, Shortname and Longname. Then we add a constraint for the primary key. All the columns in this table contain varchar values which means they contain large strings. This table will be used for the different categories of items being sold in on the e-commerce store.
    
    <span class = "nl">The next table is called customers, it has 6 columns and its organized by the customers email address. The column names are email, lastname, firstname, address, city, state, zipcode and phonenumber. This table also has varchar values with the exception of state which is a char data type. Customers obviously contains information pertaining to customers.</span>
    
    <span class = "nl">Then there is the InvoiceData table, it contains just a single column 'salesTax' and the value is money. SQL Server actually has a data type called money. This table is used to hold the values for different sales taxes.</span>
    
    <span class = "nl">Another table contains information for invoices, this one has 12 columns and is organized by the InvoiceNumber. The column names are InvoiceNumber, CustEmail, OrderDate, Subtotal, ShipMethod, Shipping, SalesTax, Total, CreditCardType, CardNumber, ExpirationMonth, ExpirationYear. The data values for invoices table: InvoiceNumber is int, orderdate is a datetime value, subtotal money, shipping money, salestax money, total money, expiration date and expiration year both small int. The rest of the values are varchar. </span>
        
    <span class = "nl">The Invoice table contains the billing information for the product and the customers credit card information for that order.</span>
        
    <span class = "nl">Here we have a table called LineItems which contains two primary keys, one which holds the InvoiceNumber and another ProductId. The table contains 5 columns, the two primary keys already mentioned then the unit price as money, the quanity as int and extension as a product of the quanity and price.  Note, that the persisted keyword implies that new values will be calculated as they are inserted into the table. </span>
        
    <span class = "nl">Now we have the products table, this table contains eight columns starting with ProductID, name, ShortDecription, LongDescript, CategoryID, ImageFile, UnitPrice and OnHand. The short and long description simply refers to what the user will be seeing when they are just browsing the products as appose to if they were to click on a product. The imagefile column contains data relevant to the location and name of the file, and onhand I am assuming refers to if the item is currently in stock. The unitprice column data type is money, onhand is int, and productid is char, the rest are varchar data types.</span></p>
    
    <hr />
    
    <h3>Inserting Values and Adding Constratints</h3>
        
    <p>Here we insert the values into each columns, as I mentioned in the comments of the script. Setting identity insert to on or off refers to the values inserted into the primary key. Usually a primary key is autoincremented, so setting the identity insert to on allows the developer to insert any value into this column.
        
    <span class = "nl">Finally, we add our foreign key constrains. Which are important for maintaining the integrity of our data. Whats the point of us having a table which has a product of mask and product key of 1 in one table and that same product key equal to two in another table. </span>
        
    <span class = "nl">Using references and constraints ensures that the item mask will have its product key as 1 reguardless of the table or who is inserting the data.</span>
    </p>
