        <h1>First Program - OpenGL Graphics Programming</h1>
        
        <h2>First Program</h2>
        
            <p>In this tutorial we will be using small snippets of code in order to understand various functions built into the OpenGL framework.  My suggestion is not to get to caught up in trying to understand everything at once.  Rather, take your time understanding the concepts and ideas.
        
        <span class="nl">Once those ideas are cemented in your mind, you will find it easier to read larger programs and eventually write your own.</span> </p>
        
    <em>Code:</em>
    <!-- Code -->
    <pre class="code">
    #include "sb6.h"
    
    class my_applications : public sb6::application
    {
        void render(double currentTime)
        {
            static const GLfloat red[] = { 1.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f };
            glClearBufferfv(GL_COLOR, 0, red);
        }
    };
    
    DECLARE_MAIN(my_application);</pre>
        
    <p>For now let's focus on the 'glClearBufferfv()' function.</p>
        
    <hr />    
        
    <!-- clear buffer -->    
    <h3>glClearBufferfv</h3>
        
        <p>The glClearBufferfv function will tell you a lot about the structure of how OpenGL framework is built.  The first thing you will notice about it is that the function name begins with the letters 'gl' which is great for identifying the use of GL function.
        
        <span class = "nl">The next thing you will notice is is that the function accepts 3 parameters. </span> 
            
        <span class="nl">GLenum buffer: An enumeration specified in the third parameter.</span>   
        <span class="nl">GLint drawBuffer: Determines the number of buffers which need to be cleared. </span> 
        <span class="nl">GLfloat * value: The value of the color itself.</span> 
            
        <span class="nl">Let's talke about the last parameter GLfloat * value.  Notice how we declared the value of our enumeration earlier 'static const GLfloat', then set it equal to an array red [] = { 1.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f }.</span>
            
        <span class = "nl">The first value in the array tells our program how much of the value red we should use, it was set to 1.0f (f for float), so 100 percent. The next value in the array will determine the amount of green, which is set to 0.0f, the next determines how much blue (0.0f), and finally the opacity or transparency of the color. </span>
            
        <span class="nl">If you know how red, green, blue values work on a computer then you would know that if we set all the colors to 0.0f it would display black, and if we changed the values to 1.0f it would display white.  Similarly we can intercahnge values to create different colors like pink or aqua.</span>
            
        <span class="nl">So there you have it, the clear buffer function just determines the color of the buffer. In our next example I will show how we can change the color of the buffer with a timer.</span></p>
        
        <hr />
        
    <!-- Clearing the buffer with timer -->
    <h3>Changing the buffer</h3>
        
        <p>In our next example we will use math to change the color of the buffer over a short span of time.</p>
        
    <em>Code:</em>
    <!-- code -->
    <pre class="code">
    #include "sb6.h"
    #include &lt;math.h>

    class my_application : public sb6::application
    {
        void render(double currentTime)
        {
            const GLfloat color[] = { (float)sin(currentTime) * 0.5f + 0.5f,
            (float)cos(currentTime) * 0.5f + 0.5f, 0.0f, 1.0f };
            glClearBufferfv(GL_COLOR, 0, color);
        }
    };

    DECLARE_MAIN(my_application);</pre>
        
        
        <p>When we run the program you will notice how the buffer changes from yellow, orange, green and then to red again.  In order to understand this we should understand some of the variables being used in this example.
        
        <span class = "nl">The first big change we made is including the 'math.h' header to use sin and cos variables. Trigonometry/Geometry is a large part using OpenGL so you should be familiar with sine and cosine if you wish to keep progressing with this tutorial.  Here is a link which should provide some clarity. <a href="https://www.mathsisfun.com/sine-cosine-tangent.html" target="_blank">Basics Trigometry</a>.</span>
            
        <span class="nl">Okay, let's look at the parameter we are multiplying by 'currentTime'.  Our currentTime value is set by the number of seconds since the application was started.  This means that it is constantly increasing or incrementing itself by intervals of one second. </span>
            
        <span class="nl">Multiplying a changing value (time) by the value of the colors in red and green will produce a variety of colors.  Of course if it changed the code to only include 1 color instead of two, we would just see different shades of that color from dark to light.</span></p>
