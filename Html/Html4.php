<h1>Standard Form - Learning HTML</h1>

<h2>Creating forms</h2>
    
<p>Forms are necessary for allowing the user to interact with the website.  Forms also organize information provider by the user, so the website can handle different operations without relying on the developer to manually do anything.
    
    <span class = "nl">A form will have 4 main tags.  'Form action' tag which starts the form, 'Fieldset' tag which allows you to manage how the form will (visually) look later once you get to learn css, 'Legend' tag labels the form so the user knows what they are filling out, 'Label' tag informs user what the text field is requiring and finally the ' Input' tag which, is where you will store data input from the user.</span></p>

<h2> Standard form </h2>

<p>Our basic form will start like this</p>

<em>Code:</em>
<!-- Code Section -->
<pre class = "code">
&#60;form action = " "> 
    &#60;p> 
        &#60;input type = "text" 
                     id = "txtname"
                     name = "txtName" 
                     size = "20"
                     maxlength = "30"
                     value = "Please enter your name here" /> 
    &#60;/p>
&#60;/form></pre>
<br />

<!-- Example -->
<em>Example:</em>
<br />
<form action = " ">
 <p>
  <label>Name</label>
  <input type = "text"
  	name = "txtName"
    size = "20"
    maxlength = "30"
  	value = "Enter your name here"/>
 </p>
</form>

<!-- Advanced Forms -->
<h2> Password's and Multi-line Forms </h2>

    <p>In order to create a form which has multiple lines or one which hides the password a user would input in the text field, we would need to simply add more labels and text boxes.</p>

<!-- Code Section -->
<pre class = "code">
&#60;form action = " ">
    &#60;field set>
        &#60;legend> Our Form &#60;/legend> 
            &#60;p>
                &#60;label> Here you can enter your name &#60;/label>
                &#60;input type = "text"
                             id = "txtname"
                             name = "txtname"
                             size = "20"
                             maxlength = "30"
                             value = "" />
                &#60;label> Please enter your password &#60;/label>
                &#60;input type = "password"
                             id = "pwd"
                             name = "pwd" 
                             size = "20"
                             maxlegnth = "30"
                             value = "secret" />
            &#60;/p>
            &#60;p>
                &#60;label> Second Question? &#60;/label>
            &#60;/p>
            &lt;p>
                &#60;text area name = "txt Answer2"
                                  rows = "10"
                                  cols = "40">  Enter your comments . . .
                &#60;/text area>
            &#60;/p>
&#60;/field set></pre>

<p>Notice how this time we used a field set and we used a legend to label our field set.  Also, instead of setting the input type to text field, we changed it to password and we also changed our id to password which will alter the characters we use to asterisks.</p>

<!-- Example -->
<em>Example:</em>
<br /><br />
<form action = " ">
<fieldset>
 <legend> Password/Multiline form </legend>
 <p>
  <label> Here you can enter your name </label>
  <input type = "text"
  	 name = "txtName"
     size = "20"
     maxlength = "30"
	 value = "" />
 </p>

 <p>
  <label> Now you can enter a password </label>
  <input type = "password"
  	 name = "pwd"
     size="20"
     maxlength="30"
  	 value = "" />
 </p>

 <p>
  <label> If you want to tell me a little bit about yourself? </label>
 </p>

 <p>
  <textarea id = "textArea"
  	    rows = "10"
	    cols = "40"> Enter your comments . . . </textarea>
 </p>
</fieldset>
</form>

<p> Notice how the main difference between the two forms we used was the legend and the fieldset.  Also, the fact that we can create a larger text field by using '&lt;textarea/&gt;' makes all the difference in the type of forms we can create.</p>
