<h1>Functions - C++ Development</h1>
    
<!-- Functions -->
<h2>Dividing your work with functions</h2>
    
    <p>   Functions, are basically a set of pre existing instructions which we can call upon by writing the name of the function in our main function.  In the example below, we are going to use a function called ef-abs to change a negative number into a positive one.

        <span class="nl">ef-abs returns numbers as absolutes im sure the notation in math looks similar to this | 5 |.  However, in order to use our function, we need to add another includes statement, one that contains the library for our math functions.</span>
    </p>

<!-- Example -->
<em>Example:</em>
<!-- Code section -->
<pre class = "code">
#include &#60;iostream&#62;
#include &#60;math.h&#62;
using namespace std;
    
int main()
{
    cout &lt;&lt; fabs (-10.5) &lt;&lt; endl;
    return 0;
}</pre>

<br />

<!-- passing a variable -->
<h3>Passing a variable</h3>

    <p> In this example we are going to use another function called 'pow'.  This function allows you to use exponents.  So if you wanted to square, cube or multiply a number to the power of ten, then you would use the function pow (short for power, maybe?).
        
    <span class="nl">In the example below, we are going to pass the function pow into the value of a variable.</span></p>

<!-- Example -->
<em>Example:</em>
<!-- Code section -->
<pre class = "code">
#include &#60;iostream&#62;
#include &#60;math.h&#62;
using namespace std;
    
int main()
{
    double number = 10.0;
    double exponent = 3.0;
    cout &lt;&lt; pow (number, exponent) &lt;&lt; endl;
    return 0;
}</pre>

    <p> What we did is: we declared two numbers and intialized them to ten and three.  Then we used our function pow and in the parameters we used the variables we created instead of writing 10 and 3.

<span class="nl">Our output is a thousand or ten to the power of three.  Remember that we needed to add the '#include &#60;math.h#&#62;' in order to use both the pow and the fabs functions.</span></p>

<!-- Writing our own functions -->
<h3>Writing our own functions</h3>

    <p>Finally, we can create our very own functions.  We have already been writing a main function for our programs, this time we are going to write another function which adds a number on to a variable.</p>

<!-- Example -->
<em>Example:</em>
<!-- Code section -->
<pre class = "code">
#include &#60;iostream&#62;
using namespace std;
    
int AddOne(int start)
{
    int numberx; 
    numberx = start + 1; 
    return numberx; 
}

int main()
{
    int testnumber, result;
    testnumber = 15;
    result = AddOne(testnumber);
    cout &lt;&lt; result &lt;&lt; endl;
    return 0;
}</pre>

    <p>    Okay, first don't get overwhelmed because even thou this looks complicated its actually very simple.
        
        <span class="nl">   Let's look at this code a little more closer, i'm going to highlight certain areas of the code and explain them in more detail.</span>  </p>

<!-- Example -->
<em>Example:</em>
<!-- Code section -->
<pre class = "code">
#include &#60;iostream&#62;
using namespace std;

int<span style ="color: purple"> AddOne</span>( int <span style ="color: red"> start</span>)
{
        int <span style = "color:fuchsia">numberx;</span>
    <span style = "color:fuchsia">numberx </span>= <span style = "color:red">start</span> + 1;
    return <span style = "color:fuchsia">numberx; </span><br />
}

int main()
{
        int <span style = "color:red">testnumber</span>, <span style = "color:fuchsia">result</span>;
        <span style = "color:red">testnumber</span> = 15;
        <span style = "color:fuchsia">result</span> = <span style ="color: purple">AddOne</span>(<span style = "color:red">testnumber</span>);
        cout &lt;&lt; <span style = "color:fuchsia">result</span> &lt;&lt; endl;
    return 0;
}</pre>

    <p>    Alright, so we have a lot of funny colors in this code.  How are we going to make sense of it all.
       
        <span class="nl"><span style = "color:red">  Let's call the red variables the input. The input is the variable we wish to:</span></span>
        Change, to affect using our function. 
        
        <span class="nl"><span style = "color:fuchsia">Now, lets look at the pink variables.  The pink variables are the:</span></span>
        Output or what we wish to return.
      
        <span class="nl"><span style = "color:purple">Finally, lets look at the purple function.  The purple function is the:</span></span>
        Process we call in order to transform our input into our output / return.     </p>

<dl>
    <dt>Function</dt>
        <dd>A process used to carry out instructions to our data.</dd>
    <dt>Input</dt>
        <dd>A variable used in a function, we input variables we wish to change using our function.</dd>
    <dt>Return</dt>
        <dd>A return is a variable which is returned after our function has made changes to it.</dd>
</dl>
