<h1>Pointing to Function - C++ Development</h1>
    
<!-- Data through pointers -->    
<h2>Pointing to functions</h2>
    
    <p>    We are going to continue to talk about pointers and functions.  In this section we are going to return a pointer variable from one of our pointer functions.    </p>
    
<!-- Returning a pointer variable -->
<h3>Returning a pointer variable from a function</h3>
    
    <p>Okay, I am going to challenge you with this next program because i will be introducing three new concepts.
        
    <span class = "nl">First, lets remember what a pointer does, it refers to a location (address). If we have a function which returns a string, we are asking for a string (a word or phrase), if we have a function which returns an int, we are asking for an integer (a number or expression), and finally if we have a function which is a pointer we are asking for it to return a location.  </span>
        
    <span class = "nl">Just keep that in mind.</span> </p>
    
<!-- Example -->
<em>Example:</em>
<!-- Code section -->
<pre class = "code">
<span class = "comments">/* Passing pointer variables through functions */</span>  
#include &#60;iostream&#62; 
#include &#60;sstream&#62;
using namespace std;

string *GetCode() 
{
    string *code = new string; 
    code->append("CR");
    
    int randNumber = rand(); 
    ostringstream converter;
    converter &lt;&lt; randNumber; 
    
    code->append(converter.str()); 
    code->append("NQ");

    return code;  
} 
    
int main() 
{  
    string *newcode; 
    int index; 
        
    for (index = 0; index &lt; 10; index++) 
    { 
        newcode = GetCode();  
        cout &lt;&lt; *newcode &lt;&lt; endl;
    } 
    return 0;
}</pre>

<p>Ok let's break this program down step by step.</p>
    
<ol id = "li2">
<li>Add our includes for our input/output library and for our string stream library.   </li>   
<li>Using namespace std so we don't have to write that for our cout and endl commands. </li> 
<li>Create our pointer function declaring it as a string, which means it will be used to locate the address of only strings. </li> 
<li>Declare our pointer as a string and use the new function so that it will be stored in the heap. 
</li> 
<li>Use the append function on our pointer to add the letters CR to the beginning of any string addresses.
</li> 
<li>Declare and intialize an int variable containing the random function (will generate a random number).   
</li> 
<li> Declare a variable named converter to data type ostringstream.
</li> 
<li>Use the insertion (&lt;&lt;) operator in order for the variable converter to return random number variable.   
</li>
<li>Use the append function to our pointer to append randomn numbers returned by the converter variable.  Use the str() function on our converter function to have our numbers returned as strings.
</li>
<li>Use the append function once again to add the letters NQ to the code address which, by now probably has the letters CR and a randomn number.
</li> 
<li>Return the location as a variable called code. 
</li> 
<li>Start our main function.    
</li> 
<li>Declare a pointer as a string type called newcode.    
</li> 
<li>Create a for loop which has ten iterations.    
</li> 
<li>Intialize our pointer with our pointer function 'getcode()'.  
</li> 
<li>Use cout to display the contents of our function.  It will repeat ten times as per the loop.   
</li>
</ol>
    
<p>Okay, you probably have some questions.  What is: ostringstream, rand(), and str() functions? </p>

<dl>
    <dt>ostringstream</dt>
        <dd>Allows the use of the insertion (&lt;&lt;) or extraction (>>) operator to perform input and output (called streams).</dd> <br />
    <dt>rand()</dt>
        <dd>Generates a randomn number.</dd> <br />
        <dt>str()</dt>  
        <dd>Returns a string version of the variable.</dd>
</dl>
