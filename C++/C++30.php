<h1>Classes &amp; Pointers - C++ Development</h1>

<h2>Working with Classes</h2>
    
   <p>In this section we are going to introduce pointers to our classes and explain how to change member variables in classes by using pointers.  </p>    
<!-- Classes and Pointers -->
<h3>Classes and Pointers</h3>
    
    <p>    In this section, I am going to show you how to point to variables within a class.  In order to do this we need to create a pointer, and in order for us to use a pointer from a class we need to write the name of the class first before declaring the object, so the compiler knows this pointer belongs to 'this' class. 
        
        <span class = "nl">Remember when we first used pointers, how they referred to the location of an object in memory rather than the object itself.</span></p>

<em>Code:</em>
<!-- code -->
<pre class="code">
int pen = 20; 
cout &lt;&lt; &#38;pen &lt;&lt; endl; </pre>
    
<p>Yet, knowing the location of a variable was not enough we needed a pointer to be able to manipulate it.</p>
   
<em>Code:</em>
<!-- code -->
<pre class = "code">int *ptr, pen = 20; 
ptr = &#38;pen; 
cout &lt;&lt; ptr &lt;&lt; endl; </pre> 
    
<p>Now we know that if we use the pointer variable, it will show us the value of pen, because we set the pointer variable equal to the location of pen in the memory (on the heap).  We want to emulate this concept in order to modify variables in our classes.
    
    <span class = "nl">However, in order for us to modify variables in our classes, we need to place the pointer on the heap (quick access memory location).  And for us to place the pointer on the heap we need to use the function new. </span></p>
    
<em>Code:</em>
<!-- code -->
<pre class="code"> Pen *ptr; 
ptr = new Pen;
cout &lt;&lt; ptr &lt;&lt; endl;</pre> 
    
<p> or </p>
    
<em>Code:</em>
<!-- code -->
<pre class="code"> Pen *ptr = new Pen;
cout &lt;&lt; ptr &lt;&lt; endl;</pre>
    
<!-- Accessing class members using pointers -->
<h3>Accessing object members using pointers</h3>
    
    <p>Remeber when we used pointers to access variables from a function. We had to use parenthese to enclose the pointer in order to use a function.</p>
    
<!-- code -->
<div class="code">(*ptr).length(); </div> 
    
<p>However, there is an alternate way to do this without having to enclose our pointer in parenthese.</p>
    
<!-- code -->
<div class="code">ptr->length(); </div> 
    
<p>Let's see an example of this put into action to change the value of a member variable from class pen.</p>
    
<em>Example:</em>
<!-- Code -->
<pre class="code">
<span class="comments">/* Changing a class variable using a pointer */</span> 
#include &#60;iostream> 
#include "Pen.h" 
using namespace std; 
    
int main()
{
    Pen *ptrPen;
    ptrPen = new Pen;
    ptrPen->InkColor = red;
    cout &lt;&lt; ptrPen->InkColor &lt;&lt; endl; 
    delete ptrPen;
    ptrPen = 0;
    return 0; 
}</pre>
  
<p>Let's take a look at this program step by step.</p>
    
<ol id = "li2">
<li>Declare pointer ptrPen.</li>
<li>Turn the pointer into an object using new function.</li>
<li>Use the pointer object to access and change the value of a member variable from the class pen.</li>
<li>Delete the object to save memory.</li>
<li>Clear the pointer by changing it's value to zero.</li>
</ol>
