<h1>Nested Loops, Using Directive - C++ Developemt</h1>
    
<!-- Directly C++ Program Flow -->
<h2>Directing C++ program flow cont.</h2>
    
    <p>    We are going to talk about nested loops  and comments in this section.  Basically a loop nested within another loop and a comment are instructions for what the program does without effecting the code.
        
<span class="nl">   Be warned nesting loops can become extremely complicated so, its important to understand what the loop does step by step before running the program.  In some cases, you will just run one loop at a time to ensure that it works before trying to embed it within another loop (in an effort to minimize errors).</span>  </p>

<h3>Nested Loops</h3>
    
    <p>  What exactly is a nested loop and how would it perform? </p>
    
<!-- Example -->
<em>Example:</em>
<!-- Code section -->
<pre class = "code">
#include &#60;iostream&#62;
using namespace std;
    
int main()
{
    int x, y;
    for (x = 1; x &lt;= 10; x++)
    {
        cout &lt;&lt; "Number of " &lt;&lt; x &lt;&lt; endl;
        for (y = 1; y &lt;= 10; y++)
        {
            cout &lt;&lt; x * y &lt;&lt; endl;
        }
        cout &lt;&lt; endl;
    }
    cout &lt;&lt; " All done!" &lt;&lt; endl;
    return 0;
}</pre>
    
<p>Ok, this looks interesting, but what exactly is happening?  Lets break this program down step by step.</p>

<ol id = "li2">
<li>We declare both x and y to be int variables.</li>
<li>Our first for loop intializes x equal to one and increments it by one.</li>
<li>Our first for loop is set to false once x becomes equal to or greater than ten.</li>
<li>Our first loop writes the Number of plus the value of x.</li>
<li>We start our second loop which is embedded within our first, this loop intializes y equal to one and increments y by one until y.</li>
<li>Our second nested loop is set to false once y becomes equal to or greater than ten.</li>
<li>Y is multipled by the value of x and then loops itself multiplying itself by x every time while increasing its value by one.</li>
<li>So, 1 * 1 on the first iteration of our second for loop, then 1 * 2, until 1 * 10, then the loop will end.</li>
<li>Our first loop picks up by writing endl starting on a new line and then checks the value of x to see if it is equal to or less than ten, x is equal to one.  After checking the value it increments x by one setting it equal to two, and starting the second iteration of our first loop.</li>
<li>In our first loop we write our cout statement along with the value of x and then proceed to our nested loop.</li>
<li>Our second nested loop checks the value of y to see if its less than or equal to ten.  Then it mutliplies its value to the value of x by y which is equal to one, once again.</li>
<li>This time y is multiplying by x's second iteration so the math will look like: 2 * 1, 2 * 2, until 2 * 10.</li>
</ol>

<!-- practical example -->
<h3>Practical application for nested loop</h3>

    <p>    Imagine you had two routines, one routine which you repeated every week and another routine which you repeated every day.  Let's say the first routine was going to work and the second routine was getting paid on friday.

        <span class="nl">  You could write a nested loop to calculate the amount of money you get paid over the course of a month by using one loop for the money you made from day to day, and another loop for the money you made week to week. </span>
        
        <span class="nl">In the program below, I went even further by adding an additional nested loop in order to calculate the amount of money made per year.</span>
    </p>

<!-- Example -->
<em>Example:</em>
<!-- Code section -->
<pre class = "code">
#include &#60;iostream&#62;
using namespace std;
    
int main()
{
    int x, y, w, z = 0;
    for (w = 1; w &lt;=12; w++)
    {
        for (x = 1; x &lt;= 4; x++)
        {
            cout &lt;&lt; "Week number " &lt;&lt; x &lt;&lt; ", Month Number "&lt;&lt; w &lt;&lt; endl;
            for (y = 1; y &lt;= 5; y++)
            {
                z += 40;
                cout &lt;&lt; "day " &lt;&lt; y &lt;&lt; " money = " &lt;&lt; z &lt;&lt; endl;
            }
            cout &lt;&lt; "Money made this month " &lt;&lt; z &lt;&lt; endl;
            cout &lt;&lt; endl;
        }
    }
    cout &lt;&lt; "Money made this year " &lt;&lt; z &lt;&lt; endl;
    cout &lt;&lt; " All done!" &lt;&lt; endl;
    return 0;
}</pre>

<p>Even thou i didn't use a while, if, else, do-while, break or continue statement in this example, that doesn't mean that we can't combine any of those statements or loops in order to write our programs.</p>

<!-- Comments -->
<h3>Using Comments</h3>

    <p> Up until now, we haven't bothered to use any comments.  Yet, with a program this complication, it might be necessary to add. This is so that if other people want to use our work, or if we want to reuse our code in the future, we will remember what does what and why we added that code, etc.   </p>

<!-- Example -->
<em>Example:</em>
<!-- Code section -->
<pre class = "code">
<span class = "comments">/* Create a program to calculate the amount of money i make per year
if i make 40 dollars a week and work 5 days a week every week. */</span>
#include &#60;iostream&#62;
using namespace std;
    
int main()
{
    <span class = "comments">// declare x (week tally), y (day tally), w (month tally), z (dollar amount)</span>
    int x, y, w, z = 0;
    <span class = "comments">// create a loop for the months of the year</span>
    for (w = 1; w &lt;=12; w++)
    {    
        <span class = "comments">// create a loop for weeks in a month</span>
        for (x = 1; x &lt;= 4; x++)
        {
            cout &lt;&lt; "Week number " &lt;&lt; x &lt;&lt; ", Month Number "&lt;&lt; w &lt;&lt; endl;
            <span class = "comments">// create a loop for days in a week</span>
            for (y = 1; y &lt;= 5; y++)
            {
                <span class = "comments">// add the amount of money made to each day</span>
                z += 40;
                cout &lt;&lt; "day " &lt;&lt; y &lt;&lt; " money = " &lt;&lt; z &lt;&lt; endl;
            }
    
            <span class = "comments">// write out total money made this month</span>
            cout &lt;&lt; "Money made this month " &lt;&lt; z &lt;&lt; endl;
            cout &lt;&lt; endl;
        }
    }
    <span class = "comments">// write out total money made this year</span>
    cout &lt;&lt; "Money made this year " &lt;&lt; z &lt;&lt; endl;
    cout &lt;&lt; " All done!" &lt;&lt; endl;
    return 0;
}</pre>

    <p>If you use forward slash then asterisk you can comment out as much as you want to, keeping in mind that you will need to close it as well with a another asterisk forward slash. 

    <span class="nl">/* write your comments */</span>
        
    <span class="nl">Alternatively you can write forward slash forward slash with comments everything written on that single line.</span>
        
    <span class="nl">// all of this will be commented it out until i press return</span>// i wrote two more forward slashes so that this is commented our as well.</p>
