<h1>Storing Data - C++ Development</h1>

<!-- Storing Data -->
<h2>Storing Data in C++, Programming Terms cont.</h2>

    <p>    In this section we are going to talk about how to store values using variables and how to allow users to input their own values into variables as well.  Also, we will continue to review more programming terms.    </p>
    
<hr />
    
<!-- Programming Terms -->
<h3>Types and Objects</h3>
    
    <p>    Let's cover some of the basic terms that are associated with this next section.    </p>
    
<dl>
    <dt>Type</dt>
        <dd>Defines a set of possible values and opertaions for an object. Int is a data type which can store whole numbers.</dd>
    
    <dt>Object</dt>
        <dd>Some memory that holds a value for a given type. A variable is an object, because it can store a value.</dd>
    
    <dt>Value</dt>
        <dd>A set of bits in memory intrepreted according to a type. If I declared an int be named 'Val' and assigned a value of 5, then 5 would be the value ( int val = 5; ).  </dd> 
    
    <dt>Variable</dt>
        <dd>A named object. If I declared an int be named 'Val', then 'Val' would be considered a variable (int val; ).</dd>
    
   <dt>Declaration</dt>
        <dd>A statement that gives a name to an object. Naming an int is considered to be considered a declaration. ( int val; )</dd> 
    <dt>Definition</dt>
        <dd>A declaration that sets aside memory for an object, so if you declare and initialize an data type, its defined ( int Val = 5; ).</dd>
    
    </dl>
    
    
<!-- Creating Variables -->
<h3>Creating a Variable</h3>
    
    <p>    Below you will see examples on how to declare and intialize a variable.  </p>
 
<!-- Example -->
<em>Example:</em>
<!-- Code section -->
<pre class = "code">
#include &#60;iostream&#62;
using namespace std;
    
int main()
{
    int mynumber;
    mynumber = 10;
    cout &lt;&lt; mynumber &lt;&lt; endl;
    
    return 0;
}</pre>

<p>So, we used <strong>'#include &#60; iostream &#62;'</strong> to use the library from the input output stream.  We used the <strong>namespace std;</strong> to save ourselves from having to type in std for cout and endl.

    <span class = "nl"> We start our main function by declaring it an int and opening our curly braces.  Now, we declared our variable <strong>mynumber</strong> as an integer (which means that the value will have to be a number) and then we intialized it by setting our variable to equal the number ten, ' <strong>mynumber = 10;</strong>'.</span>

<span class = "nl"> From here, we simply displayed the value of our variable using cout, '<strong>cout &lt;&lt; mynumber &lt;&lt; endl; </strong>' and then we ended our main function by returning a value of zero.</p>

<hr />

<!-- Changing variables -->
<h3>Changing Variables</h3>
    <p>    Variables are like storage units, they don't remain permentatly attached to the value they are set to (unless specificied).  We can change the value of a variable by setting it's value to something else.    </p>

<em>Code:</em>
<!-- Code section -->
<pre class = "code">
#include &#60;iostream&#62;
using namespace std;
    
int main()
{
    int mynumber;
    mynumber = 10;
    cout &lt;&lt; mynumber &lt;&lt; endl;   
    mynumber = 20;
    cout &lt;&lt; mynumber &lt;&lt; endl;
    return 0;
}</pre>
<br />

    <p>    What happened to our value of 10?  It is replaced by 20 and now mynumber will always have a value of 20 unless we change it again.    </p>

<hr />

<!-- Copying values -->
<h3>Copying a values from one variable to another</h3>

    <p>    We can also set variables to equal a value and then move that value from one variable to another by using our relational operator the equals sign.    </p>

<em>Code:</em>
<!-- Code section -->
<pre class = "code">
#include &#60;iostream&#62;
using namespace std;
    
int main()
{
    int start = 50;
    int finish;
    finish = start;
    cout &lt;&lt; finish &lt;&lt; endl;
    return 0;
}</pre>

<p>In this example, we simply declare and intialized start to equal 50 all on the same line.  Then we declared another variable called finish to an integer.  Finally, we set finish to equal start and displayed the value of finish using our cout.</p>
