<h1>Conditional Operators and Boolean Values - C++ Development</h1>

<!-- Conditional Operators and Boolean Values -->
<h2>Conditional Operators and Boolean Values</h2>
    
    <p>    So far we have covered variables by name, by type and by value.  The name is what we refer to the variable as, the type is the data type (int, char, string, etc.), the value is what the variable is storing.

        <span class = "nl">  We will use this section to talk about conditional operators and understand the true false values of boolean types and how they can be used in our program to develop flow.</span> </p>

<!-- Conditional Operators -->
<h3>Conditional operators</h3>  

    <p>First we should start off by saying that in programming a condition is a set of circumstances.  An operator is something which performs a function, so add this value to this value, subtract this variable from this and tell me the difference of the two, etc.

    <span class = "nl">  A conditional operator is used to compare one circumstance to another.</span></p>

<!-- Example -->
<em>Example:</em>
<!-- Code section -->
<pre class = "code">
#include &#60;iostream&#62;
using namespace std;
   
int main()
{
    int first = 10;
    int second = 20;
    string result;
    <strong> result = (first == second) ? "equal" : "not equal"; </strong>
    cout &lt;&lt; result &lt;&lt; endl;
    return 0;
}</pre>

    <p> Let's take a moment to look at the boldface text.  A string named result will store one of two values: equal or not equal.  We set Result to equal first compared to second, question mark (if) those values are equal, set result equal to the first word in quotes, if those valus are not equal set result equal to the second word in quotes.
        
        <span class = "nl">So the conditional operator is the equal equal sign.  It was used to compare to values to another.  Below is a set of other conditional operators.</span> </p>

<dl>
    <dt>Equal Equal ==</dt>
        <dd>Compares to values to see if they are equal to each other.</dd>
    
     <dt>Less than &lt;</dt>
        <dd>Compares one value to another to see if one is less than the other.</dd>

     <dt>Less than or Equal to &lt;=</dt>
        <dd>Compares one value to another to see if one is less than or equal to the other.</dd>

 <dt>Greater than ></dt>
        <dd>Compares one value to another to see if one is greater than the other.</dd>

 <dt>Greater than or Equal to >=</dt>
        <dd>Compares one value to another to see if one is greater than or equal the other.</dd>

     <dt>Not equal to !=</dt>
        <dd>Compares one value to another to see if not is not equal to the other, the opposite of equal equal equal.</dd>

</dl>

<!-- Boolean Variables -->
<h3>Boolean variables</h3>

    <p>We have spoke about variables which contain numbers (int), characters (char) and even whole words or sentences (string).
  
    <span class = "nl">Let's talk about boolean variables.  A boolean variable is a variable that can only contain one of two values: true or false.  It's very simple, these values are used to determine the condition of a program.  Like, if this is true than do 'this' and if this is false do 'this' instead.</span>  </p>

<em>Example:</em>
<!-- Code section -->
<pre class = "code">
#include &#60;iostream&#62;using namespace std;
   
int main()
{
    bool finished = true;
    cout &lt;&lt; finished &lt;&lt; endl;
    finished = false;
    cout &lt;&lt; finished &lt;&lt; endl;
     return 0;
}</pre>
    
    <p>What did we notice from this application?  How does the computer display boolean values.  The console showed 1 for true and 0 for false, because the computer stores these values as 1's and 0's. </p>
