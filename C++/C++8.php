<!-- Variables and Operators-->
<h2>Variables and Operators</h2>
    
    <p>Before we move on, I want to make sure that i have covered this topic.  I will provide a list of variables and operators as well as their functions.</p>
    
<!-- Variables -->
<h3>Variables</h3>    
    
    <p>Some variables you will use to store and retrieve data.  Each variable has its own data type and will only be able to store data of that specific type (don't expect an integer to store a string value).</p>
    
    <dl>
        <dt>Integers (int)</dt>
            <dd>Store's whole numbers like one (1) and ten (10), can be used with other ints.</dd>
        
        <dt>Double (double)</dt>
            <dd>Store's floating point numbers like one point five (1.5) or point three three (0.33), can be used with ints or other doubles.</dd> 
        
        <dt>Character (char)</dt>
            <dd>Store's individual characters like 'a' (requires single quotes), can be used with strings.</dd>
        
        <dt>String (string)</dt>
            <dd>Can store whole words or sentences like "Hello World" (requires double quotes), can be used with chars.</dd>
        
        <dt>Boolean (bool)</dt>
            <dd>Store's true false values, must be either true or false.</dd>
    </dl>

<!-- Operations and operators -->
<h3>Operations and operators</h3>
    
    <p>    Below you will find several operators and how they are used. <br /><br /> Don't confuse operators with operands.  An operator is a symbol used to complete an operation, while an operand is the value which the symbol is used to compute.  In 3 + 5 = 8.  3, 5 and 8 are the operands, + and = are the operators and the whole line is called an expression.</p>
    
<dl>
    <dt>Assignment ( = )</dt>
        <dd>Assigns a variable name to a data type (bool, char, int, double or string).</dd> 
    
    <dt>Addition ( + )</dt>
        <dd>Finds the sum of two or more integers or doubles.</dd>
    
    <dt>Concatenation ( + )</dt>
        <dd>Combines two strings, "hello " + "world" = "hello world".</dd>
    
    <dt>Subtraction ( - )</dt>
        <dd>Finds the difference between two or more integers or doubles.</dd>
    
    <dt>Multiplication ( * )</dt>
        <dd>Finds the product of two or more integers or doubles.</dd>
    
    <dt>Division ( / )</dt>
        <dd>Finds the quoitent of two or more integers or doubles.</dd>
    
    <dt>Remainder/modulo ( % )</dt>
        <dd>Finds the remainder of two or more integers.</dd>
    
    <dt>Increament by 1 ( ++ )</dt>
        <dd>Adds one to an integer or double.</dd>
    
    <dt>Decrement by 1 ( -- )</dt>
        <dd>Removes one from an integer or double.</dd>
    
    <dt>Increment by n ( +=n )</dt>
        <dd>Adds the value of n to an integer or double.</dd>
    
    <dt>Decrement by n ( -=n )</dt>
        <dd>Removes the value of n to an integer or double.</dd>
    
    <dt>Multiply and assign ( *= )</dt>
        <dd>Multiplies and then assigns the product two integers or doubles.</dd>
    
    <dt>Divide and assign ( /= )</dt>
        <dd>Divides and then assigns the quoitent of two integers or doubles.</dd>
    
    <dt>Remainder and assign ( %= )</dt>
        <dd>Finds the remainder and then assigns </dd>
    
    <dt>Read into ( >> )</dt>
        <dd>Reads the value from one variable into another. s reads into x ( s >> x ).  When using cin we would read the value we typed from the console, into a variable ( cin >> variableX ).</dd>
    
    <dt>Write to ( &lt;&lt; )</dt>
        <dd>Writes the value from one variable into another. x writes into s ( s &lt;&lt; x ). When using cout we would write the value on to the console from a variable ( cout &lt;&lt; variableX )</dd>    
</dl>
