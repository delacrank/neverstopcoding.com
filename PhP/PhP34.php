<h1>Classes - PhP Programming</h1>

<h2>Classes</h2>

    <p>Welcome to the section on working with classes. A class is a way to organize data and functions for larger applications.  Classes ensure that data doesn't get corrupted by using abstraction. 
    
    <span class = "nl">Before I go into explaining what abstraction is let's look at how to create a class in PhP.</span></p>
    
    <em>Code:</em>
    <!-- code -->
    <pre class="code">
    class ClassName 
    {
    }  </pre>
    
    <p>That's pretty simple, you just write the word class before the class name and then you can start adding your class variables and class functions. Let's see what this would look like.</p>
    
    <em>Code:</em>
    <!-- code -->
    <pre class="code">
    class ClassName {
        public $attribute = "hello";
        function Operation() {
            echo "this function operation";
        }
    }  </pre>
    
    <p>Let's look at some things, first notice how I had to write the word public before my first class variable. This is called an access modifer, it determines the scope of that variable. Since it is public, this means I can modify it outside of that class.
    
    <span class = "nl">Let's look to see how we can call either this function or variable in our webpage. We need to first instantiate the class using the 'new' keyword.</span></p>
    
    <em>Code:</em>
    <!-- code -->
    <pre class="code">
    $a = new ClassName;
    echo $a->attribute . '&lt;br />';
    $a->Operation();    </pre>
    <br />
    <em>Example:</em><br /><br />    
    <?php
    class ClassName {
        public $attribute = "hello";
        function Operation() {
            echo "this function operation";
        }
    }  
    $a = new ClassName;
    echo $a->attribute.'<br />';
    $a->Operation();
    ?>
    
    <p>The arrow operator (->) works similar to the dot operator ( . ) in c++ where it gives access to the variables or functions within the class if we add it write after our instance variable.
    
    <span class = "nl">The instance variable tells the program where to look in order to locate the member variables or member functions, and then we can use the arrow operator to call these variables or functions.</span></p>
    
    <hr />
    
    <!-- constructors -->
    <h3>Constructors</h3>
        
        <p>Let's look at some of the features that classes come with, in particular we are going to look at how to initialize member variables using something called a constructor. 
            
    <span class = "nl">The constructor gives us a way to create and initialize multiple instances of a class variable without having to use an outside function or without having to create a variable in our program and initialize it through that variable.</span>
    
    <span class ="nl">In order to use the constructor type function keyword followed by two underscores and the word construct, 'function __construct()'. Let's look at an example of this.</span></p>
    
    <em>Code:</em>
    <!-- code -->
    <pre class="code">
    class ClassName {
        function __construct($param)
        {
            echo 'Constructur called with parameter ' . $param; 
        }
    }
    
    $a = new ClassName('hello'); </pre>
    
    <p>Let's see if there is another way to initialize class variables using a function as oppose to a constructor or via a object (class instance). </p>
    
    <em>Code:</em>
    <!-- code -->
    <pre class = "code">
    class ClassName {
        public $attribute;
        function Set($param) {
            $this->attribute = $param;
            echo $this->attribute;
        }
    }    </pre>
    
    <p>In the example above, we simply created a function called 'set' which accepts parameters. Then by assigning the value of the parameter to the our class variable or member variable, we could set the value without having use a constructor.</p>
    
    <hr />
    
    <h2>Getters and Setters</h2>
    
        <p>Now, let's take a look at some getters and setters. First let's understand what a getter or setter is. The first thing you should understand about a getter is that it is a function which can set the value to a member functions.
    
            <span class = "nl">The way we would use a getter or setter is similar to the way we created our constructor, simply type function two underscores and then set or get ('function __set()'). </span>       
        
    <span class = "nl">Let's look at an example below.</span></p>

    <em>Code:</em>
    <!-- code -->
    <pre class = "code">
    class ClassName {
        public $attribute;
        function __get($name) {
            $this->$name;
        }
        
        function __set($name, $param) {
            $this->$name = $param;
        }
    }  </pre>
    
    <p>Using getters and setters allows you to pass limitations on what the value can be set to. For example if you want to ensure that the attribute is a number which is between 0-100, then you could add some validation to the set method.</p>
    
    <em>Code:</em>
    <!-- code -->
    <pre class="code">
    function __set($name, $value) {
        <span class = "comments">// Check to ensure the value is between 0 and 100</span>
        if( ($name="attribute") &amp;&amp; ($value >= 0) &amp;&amp; ($value &lt;= 100) )
            $this->attribute = $value;
    }</pre>
    
    <p>Let's see how you could call the setter or getter method.</p>
    
    <em>Code:</em>
    <!-- code -->
    <pre class="code">
    $a = new ClassName;
    <span class="comments">// Set variable a = 5</span>
    $a->a = 5;
    <span class="comments">// Get value of variable a</span>
    echo $a->a;
    </pre>
