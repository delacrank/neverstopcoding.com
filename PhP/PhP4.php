<h1>XHtml Forms - PhP Programming</h1>
    
<h2>PhP and xHtml forms</h2>
    
    <p>    We are going to talk about integrating forms into our dynamic web applications.  It will be very valuable to be able to store and retrieve user information. This method can be used for storing usernames, passwords, sharing information on forums, making purchases, etc.  </p>

<!-- Getting the Time -->    
<h3>Getting the Time</h3>
    
    <p>    We are going to embed our php into a xhtml doc for the purposes of showing when and where to use with xhtml.  </p>
       
    <em>Code:</em>
    <!-- Code  -->
    <pre class="code">
    &#60;p>Getting the Time, with PHP&#60;/p> 
    &lt;&#63;php
        print " &#60;p>Date: "; 
        print date("m-d"); 
        print " &#60;/p> \n"; 
        print " &#60;p> Time: "; 
        print date("h:i"); 
        print "&#60;/p>"; 
    ?></pre><br />
    
<em>Example:</em>   
<p>Getting the Time, with PHP</p>
<?php
print " <p>Date: ";
print date("m-d");
print " </p> \n";
print " <p> Time: ";
print date("h:i");
print "</p>";
?>    
    
<p>So, there was a lot more code and this can even seem a little overwhelming if you are not familiar with xhtml.
    
<span class = "nl">However, we just need to call the date function and send 'm' (month) and 'd' (day) as its arguments.  We did the same thing for time, calling the date 'h' (hour) and 'i' (minutes).  You can find out more information on different date arguements at <a href = "http://www.w3schools.com/php/func_date_date.asp">w3schools</a>.</span></p>

<!-- Sending Data -->
<h3>Sending Data to a PHP program</h3>
    
    <p>We are going to write a form where a user will input their information into a field, and that information will be collected from the field and sent to the php program to be stored.
        
        <span class = "nl">Below we are going to start out by setting up our form, notice how we use the 'method = get' (line 11, instead of 'method = post') from our form action.</span>
    
    <span class = "nl">Notice how I highlighted the value for our form action ("greetUser.php").  The program will search our folder for this file in order to input the information from our input field into this new file.  It's important that you name this form action value correctly in order for it to send the information into the correct file.</span>
    
        <span class = "nl">Also, notice how our input type name ("userName") value is highlighted, this also has to match the name we use for our POST function (see example below this one).</span> </p>
      
    <em>Code:</em>
    <!-- Code Section -->
    <pre class="code">
    &#60;!doctype html> 
        &#60;head> 
            &#60;meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /> 
            &#60;title> Main Page &#60;/title> 
        &#60;/head> 
        &#60;body> 
          &#60;form action = "<span class="highlight">greetUser.php</span>" 
                    method = "post">
            &#60;fieldset/> 
                &#60;label> Please enter your name &#60;/label> 
                &#60;input type = "text" 
                            name = "<span class="highlight">userName</span>" />  
                &#60;button type = "submit"> submit &#60;/button>
            &#60;/fieldset> 
        &#60;/form>
        &#60;/body>
    &#60;/html></pre>

<p>Alright, now let's create another php file, save this file as <u>greetUser.php</u> in order for our 'method = post' to locate this file, the directory location should be named correctly (case sensitve).</p>
      
    <em>Code:</em>
    <!-- Code -->
    <pre class="code">
    &#60;!doctype html>
        &#60;head>
            &#60;meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /> 
            &#60;title> greetUser.php &#60;/title> 
        &#60;/head> 
        &#60;body>   
            &lt;?php
                $userName = $_POST["<span class="highlight">userName</span>"]; 
                print "&#60;h1> Hi, $userName!&#60;/h1>"; 
                
                print '&lt;a href="PhP4.html">Click here to go Back&lt;/a>';
            ?>
        &#60;/body>
    &#60;/html></pre>
    
<p>Enter a name into the field and press the submit button.</p>

<em>Example:</em><br />
<!-- Example -->
<form action = "php scripts/php4.php" method = "post">
<fieldset/>
<label> Please enter your name </label>
<input type = "text" name = "userName" />
<button type = "submit"> submit </button>
</fieldset>
</form> 
    
<p>The form simply saves the name in a POST array, we assign that value to a variable called '$userName' and then print that variable in our php script.</p>
    

<br />
<hr />

<!-- Validating the form -->
<h3>Validating the form</h3>

    <p>Let's say our users don't enter any information into a certain field, how do we make sure that we don't have a bunch of empty forms?<br /><br />

We can use a keyword called empty to make sure the field is filled and if it isn't, then we can send an error message to the user.</p>

    <em>Markup:</em>
    <!-- Markup -->
    <pre class="code">
    &#60;form action = "<span class ="highlight">Validation.php</span>" 
              method = "post"></span> 
        &#60;fieldset/> 
            &#60;label> Please enter your name &#60;/label>
            &#60;input type = "text"
                       name = "<span class="highlight">userName</span>" /></span>
            &#60;button type = "submit"> submit &#60;/button>
        &#60;/fieldset> 
    &#60;/form> </pre>
<br />

    <em>Code:</em>
    <!-- Code -->
    <pre class="code">
    &lt;?php    
        if (!empty($_REQUEST["userName"])) {
            $userName = $_REQUEST["userName"]; 
            print "&lt;h1> Hi, $userName!&lt;/h1>"; 
        } else {
            $userName = null;
            echo 'Please enter a username.&lt;br />&lt;br />';
        }    
        
        print '&lt;a href="PhP4.html">Click here to go Back&lt;/a>';
    &#63;></pre>
<br />

<em>Example:</em>
<!-- Example -->
<form action = "php scripts/php4.1.php" 
method = "post"> 
<fieldset/> 
<label> Please enter your name </label> 
<input type = "text" 
name = "userName" /> 
<button type = "submit"> 
submit 
</button> 
</fieldset>
