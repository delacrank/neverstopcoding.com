<h1>Control Structures Part 2 - PhP Programming</h1>
    
<h2>Control Structures cont.</h2>
    
    <p> In this section, we are going to talk about working with comparison and logical operators. </p>
    
<hr />    
    
<!-- Comparison operators -->
<h3>Comparison operators</h3>
    
    <p>  There are several comparison operators that are used when comparing either a variable to a value or two values or two variables (anything that stores a value basically). </p>
    
<dl>
    <dt>'==' Checks for equality</dt>
        <dd>Will check values to see if they are equal.</dd>
    
    <dt>'!=' Checks for inequality</dt>
        <dd>Will check two values to see if they are not equal.</dd>
    
    <dt>'&#60;' Checks for less than values</dt>
        <dd>Will check to see if the value on the left is less than the value on the right.</dd>
    
    <dt>'>' Checks for greater than values</dt>
        <dd>Will check to see if the value on the left is greater than the value on the right.</dd>
    
    <dt>'&#60;=' Checks for less than or equal values</dt>
        <dd>Will check to see if the value on the left is less than or equal to the value on the right.</dd>
    
    <dt>'>=' Checks for greater than or equal values</dt>
        <dd>Will check to see if the value on the left is greater than or equal to the value on the right.</dd>
</dl>
    
    <p>Let's see an example of a program which uses these conditions.</p>

    <em>Code:</em>
    <!-- Code -->

<em>Example:</em><br /><br />  
<!-- Example -->    
<a href ="php scripts/php7.php">Dice Game</a>
    
    <p> Alright, let's take a look at this code because, there are a lot of variables and it can easily become very confusing. </p>
    
<ol id = "li2">
<li>If we look at this first two variables, the $DucesDie and the $DubsDie, we noticed that they are set to the randomn function to choose a number from 1 - 10.</li> 
<li>Following this, we print two pictures which are suppose to represent pictures of die numbers, where all the pictures are named the same with the exception of the last number (which are numbers 1-10 for every side of the die).</li>
<li>We make sure that the die which is suppose to represent the one's side can not hit a ten, and if it does then set it equal to zero.</li> 
<li>    In the next if statement check to see if the ten's side hits a 10, then check to see if the one's die <u>did not hit zero</u>. If ones die it hits any number (other than zero) then display that number and disreguard the tens die.  Otherwise display a perfect roll for a hundred.</li>
<li>The rest of the if else statements are just statements which  display the success of high rolls ranging from 0 - 49, 50 - 70, 80 - 90, 90 - 98, 99 and of course a 100.</li> 
</ol>

<!-- Logical Operators -->
<h3>Logical Operators</h3>
    
    <p>
    There are three type of logical operators which I will talk about in this section: 'and', 'or' and 'xor'.</p> 
        
<dl>
    <dt>&amp;&amp; - 'AND'</dt>
        <dd>Compares two conditionals to make sure that both conditions are met.</dd>
    <dt>|| - 'OR'</dt>
        <dd>Compares two conditionals to see if either one works.</dd>
    <dt>^ - 'XOR'</dt>
    <dd>Compares two conditionals to make sure at least one is <u>not</u> met.</dd>
</dl>
